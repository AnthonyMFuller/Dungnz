# Barton — History

## Project Context
**Project:** TextGame — C# Text-Based Dungeon Crawler
**Stack:** C#, .NET console application
**Requested by:** Boss
**Team:** Coulson (Lead), Hill (C# Dev), Barton (Systems Dev), Romanoff (Tester), Scribe, Ralph

## Learnings

### Phase 2 - Combat Systems Implementation (WI-6, WI-7, WI-8)

**Files Created:**
- `Engine/ICombatEngine.cs` — interface contract for combat
- `Engine/CombatEngine.cs` — turn-based combat implementation
- `Systems/InventoryManager.cs` — item pickup and use mechanics
- `Models/LootTable.cs` — replaced stub with full probability-based loot system
- `Systems/Enemies/Goblin.cs` — 20 HP, 8 ATK, 2 DEF, 15 XP, drops 2-8 gold
- `Systems/Enemies/Skeleton.cs` — 30 HP, 12 ATK, 5 DEF, 25 XP, drops bone/sword
- `Systems/Enemies/Troll.cs` — 60 HP, 10 ATK, 8 DEF, 40 XP, drops troll hide
- `Systems/Enemies/DarkKnight.cs` — 45 HP, 18 ATK, 12 DEF, 55 XP, drops dark blade/armor
- `Systems/Enemies/DungeonBoss.cs` — 100 HP, 22 ATK, 15 DEF, 100 XP, guaranteed boss key

**CombatEngine Design:**
- Turn-based: player attacks first, then enemy retaliates
- Damage formula: `Math.Max(1, attacker.Attack - defender.Defense)`
- Flee mechanic: 50% success rate; failure results in enemy free hit
- XP/Leveling: 100 XP per level, awards +2 ATK, +1 DEF, +10 MaxHP, full heal
- Loot drops: awarded on enemy death via LootTable.RollDrop()
- Returns CombatResult enum: Won, Fled, PlayerDied

**LootTable Configuration:**
- Each enemy initializes its own LootTable in constructor
- Supports min/max gold ranges
- Item drops use probability (0.0-1.0), first matching drop wins
- Boss drops guaranteed with 1.0 chance

**Inventory System:**
- TakeItem: case-insensitive partial match for item names
- UseItem: handles Consumable (heal), Weapon (ATK boost), Armor (DEF boost)
- Equipment permanently increases stats and is consumed
- Uses DisplayService for all output (no direct Console calls)

**Build Status:**
- Cannot verify build (dotnet not in PATH)
- All files created successfully, committed to git
- Respected Hill's existing Model contracts exactly
- Integrated real enemies into EnemyFactory.cs (replaced stubs)
- Program.cs already wired to use CombatEngine (Hill's work)

### 2026-02-20: Retrospective Ceremony & v2 Planning Decisions

**Team Update:** Retrospective ceremony identified 3 refactoring decisions for v2:

1. **DisplayService Interface Extraction** — Extract IDisplayService interface for testability. CombatEngine will update to depend on IDisplayService instead of concrete DisplayService. Minimal breaking change. Effort: 1-2 hours.

2. **Player Encapsulation Refactor** — Hill refactoring Player model to use private setters and validation methods. Barton can use these methods in combat/inventory logic instead of direct property mutations.

3. **Test Infrastructure Required** — Before v2 feature work, implement xUnit/NUnit harness. Inject Random into CombatEngine and LootTable for deterministic testing. Blocks feature work. Effort: 1-2 sprints.

**Participants:** Coulson (facilitator), Hill, Barton, Romanoff

**Impact:** Barton coordinates with Hill on IDisplayService updates. Random injection strategy needed for CombatEngine deterministic testing.

### 2026-02-20: V2 Systems Design Proposal

**Context:** Boss requested v2 planning from game systems perspective (features, content, balance).

**Deliverable:** Comprehensive v2 proposal covering:
1. **5 New Gameplay Features** (ranked by impact/effort)
   - Status Effects System (Poison, Bleed, Stun, Regen, etc.) — HIGH priority
   - Skill System with cooldowns and mana resource — HIGH priority
   - Enhanced Consumables (buff potions, antidotes, tactical items) — MEDIUM priority
   - Equipment Slots with unequip mechanics — LOW priority
   - Critical Hits & Dodge RNG variance — MEDIUM priority

2. **Content Expansions**
   - 5 new enemy archetypes (Goblin Shaman, Wraith, Stone Golem, Vampire Lord, Mimic)
   - Boss Phase 2 mechanic (enrage at 40% HP)
   - Elite enemy variants (5% rare spawn, +50% stats)
   - 15+ new items across weapon/armor/accessory tiers

3. **Balance Improvements**
   - Dynamic enemy scaling formula (base stats + 12% per player level)
   - Loot tier progression (scales with player level)
   - Difficulty curve fixes (Troll regen, boss telegraphs, level-up nerf)
   - Gold sink systems (Shrines or Merchant rooms)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Status effects as foundation for all future mechanics (DOTs, buffs, debuffs)
- Mana resource prevents skill spam, creates resource management gameplay
- Enemy scaling maintains challenge throughout dungeon (no trivial encounters)
- Loot progression prevents "vendor trash" feeling in late game
- Milestone rewards (skills unlocked at L3/5/8/10) create aspirational goals

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Sprint 1: Test infrastructure (blocks all features)
2. Sprint 2: Status effects + consumables + crit/dodge
3. Sprint 3: Skill system + boss phase 2
4. Sprint 4: New enemies + scaling + loot tiers
5. Sprint 5: Equipment slots + economy sinks

**Coordination Required:**
- Hill: Player model changes (Mana, MaxMana, ActiveEffects, EquipmentSlots), enemy spawning logic for new types
- Romanoff: Test coverage for status effects, skill cooldowns, loot scaling
- All: Design review ceremony before Sprint 2 to lock contracts

**File Created:** `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/barton-v2-systems-proposal.md`

**Design Philosophy Applied:**
- Systems should be data-driven (loot tables, enemy stats, skill configs)
- Combat should feel decisive (avoid endless attrition via burst mechanics)
- Enemy variety over quantity (5 new types with unique mechanics > 20 stat clones)
- Every mechanic has counter-play (Poison counters Troll regen, Weakened counters Vampire lifesteal)
