# Fitz — History

## Project Context

**Project:** TextGame — C# .NET Text-Based Dungeon Crawler  
**Owner:** Anthony  
**Team:** Coulson (Lead), Hill (C# Dev), Barton (Systems Dev), Romanoff (Tester), Fury (Content Writer), Fitz (DevOps)  
**Stack:** C#, .NET 6+  
**Current State:** 431 passing tests, core systems functional, CI/CD pipelines in place

## Key Milestones

- **2026-02-20:** Project inception, team established (Coulson, Hill, Barton, Romanoff)
- **2026-02-24:** ASCII art feature approved for implementation
- **2026-02-24:** Fury and Fitz added to roster; Phase 4 DevOps work begins

## Game Systems Overview

**Stack:**
- Language: C# (.NET 6+)
- Testing: xUnit or similar (TBD based on .csproj inspection)
- Build: dotnet CLI
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflows
- Platforms: Cross-platform console application

**Current CI/CD State:**
- GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Test suite: 431 passing tests (Romanoff's domain)
- Build automation exists but may have inconsistencies
- Known issue: `squad-release.yml` incorrectly uses Node.js test runner on .NET project

**Workflow Inventory:**
- Tests are run via GitHub Actions on pull requests and commits
- Release workflow exists but has a known bug (wrong test command)
- Build/validation workflows present but not yet audited by DevOps owner

## Phase 4: DevOps Work

**Priority Issue:**
1. Fix `squad-release.yml`: Replace `node --test test/*.test.js` with `dotnet test`

**Planned Work:**
- Audit and standardize all GitHub Actions workflows
- Ensure test infrastructure is aligned with team's test framework (xUnit, etc.)
- Optimize build times and cache strategies
- Coordinate with Romanoff on test infrastructure needs
