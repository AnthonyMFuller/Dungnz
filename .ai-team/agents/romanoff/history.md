# Romanoff — History

## Project Context
**Project:** TextGame — C# Text-Based Dungeon Crawler
**Stack:** C#, .NET console application
**Requested by:** Boss
**Team:** Coulson (Lead), Hill (C# Dev), Barton (Systems Dev), Romanoff (Tester), Scribe, Ralph

## Learnings

### 2026-02-20: WI-10 Code Review (Feature-Complete Quality Pass)
**Reviewed:** All 23 source files (Program.cs, Models, Engine, Systems, Display)
**Scope:** Bug hunting, logic errors, architectural violations, edge cases

**Issues Found (7 total):**
1. Program.cs:8-9 — Direct Console.Write/ReadLine violating DisplayService-only architecture
2. GameLoop.cs:30 — Direct Console.Write("> ") prompt violation
3. CombatEngine.cs:22 — Direct Console.Write("[A]ttack or [F]lee? ") prompt violation
4. GameLoop.cs:123-130 — Dead enemies not cleared from room after combat (HP=0 but Enemy!=null persists)
5. GameLoop.cs:109 — Win condition checked dead boss via HP<=0 instead of Enemy==null
6. Architectural violation: Multiple classes bypassing DisplayService for output
7. Logic bug: Dead enemy objects remain in rooms, could cause re-combat or confusion

**Fixes Applied (all 7 fixed):**
- Added `ShowCommandPrompt()` to DisplayService
- Added `ShowCombatPrompt()` to DisplayService  
- Added `ReadPlayerName()` to DisplayService
- Updated Program.cs to use DisplayService.ReadPlayerName()
- Updated GameLoop to use DisplayService.ShowCommandPrompt()
- Updated CombatEngine to use DisplayService.ShowCombatPrompt()
- Fixed GameLoop to set `_currentRoom.Enemy = null` after `CombatResult.Won`
- Simplified win condition to check `_currentRoom.Enemy == null` (no dead enemy object edge case)

**Patterns to Watch:**
- Console I/O violations: Always route through DisplayService
- Dead enemy cleanup: Any system that mutates enemy state must handle lifecycle
- Null vs zero HP: Prefer explicit null for "defeated" state over HP<=0 checks
- Edge case: What happens if player flees combat then returns? (Currently enemy HP persists — acceptable behavior)

**Verdict:** APPROVED
- All architectural violations corrected
- Logic bugs fixed (dead enemy cleanup)
- No null safety issues found (LootTable = null! is safe — always initialized in enemy constructors)
- Edge cases handled: empty inventory USE, GO with no arg, TAKE with no items, combat with dead enemy
- Code is ready to ship

### 2026-02-20: Retrospective Ceremony & v2 Planning Decisions

**Team Update:** Retrospective ceremony identified 3 refactoring decisions for v2:

1. **DisplayService Interface Extraction** — Extract IDisplayService interface to enable mock test implementations. Romanoff will build test harness on this interface.

2. **Player Encapsulation Refactor** — Hill refactoring Player model with validation. Improves state safety and enables future extensions (save/load, analytics).

3. **Test Infrastructure Required** — Romanoff leads test infrastructure buildout: xUnit/NUnit harness, injected Random for deterministic combat/loot testing, integration with CI/CD. Blocks v2 feature work. Effort: 1-2 sprints.

**Participants:** Coulson (facilitator), Hill, Barton, Romanoff

**Impact:** Romanoff owns test infrastructure as blocking work for v2. High priority: regression risk without tests is unacceptable for future changes.

### 2026-02-20: v2 Testing Strategy Proposal

**Authored comprehensive testing strategy for v2:**

**Framework:** xUnit 2.6+ selected over NUnit (better async, cleaner isolation, industry standard)

**Project Structure:** Dungnz.Tests project with Unit/, Integration/, Fixtures/, TestHelpers/ organization

**Mocking Strategy:**
- IDisplayService extraction required (Hill owns) → enables headless testing with Moq
- Random injection into CombatEngine/LootTable → enables deterministic testing with seeded Random
- FluentAssertions for readable test assertions

**Coverage Strategy (Must-Have Tests):**
- CombatEngine unit tests: player kills enemy, enemy kills player, flee success/failure, flee failure death, level-up mid-combat, minimum damage rule, loot distribution
- LootTable unit tests: deterministic drops, first-match-wins, gold ranges, empty loot table
- InventoryManager unit tests: TakeItem, UseItem (consumable/weapon/armor), empty inventory edge cases
- CommandParser unit tests: all commands, shortcuts, case insensitivity, argument parsing
- Player unit tests (post-encapsulation): TakeDamage, Heal, ModifyStat validation, state constraints
- DungeonGenerator integration: 5x4 grid, connectivity (BFS), spawn/exit rooms, boss placement, bidirectional exits
- GameLoop integration: combat triggers, dead enemy cleanup, exit blocking, win/lose conditions

**Manual Testing Only:** DisplayService formatting (visual validation more efficient than brittle assertions), end-to-end gameplay balance

**Edge Case Inventory (v1 Learnings + v2 Risks):**
- Dead enemy cleanup regression test (room.Enemy == null after Won)
- Flee penalty death edge case (CombatResult.PlayerDied if flee damage kills)
- Flee-and-return behavior (enemy HP persists — accepted, but must consider for save/load)
- Item stacking exploit monitoring (infinite weapon/armor equips)
- Save/load JSON deserialization safety (if added): validate HP <= MaxHP, no negative stats
- Player encapsulation validation: TakeDamage/Heal input validation, stat caps enforced

**Quality Gates:**
- Build gates: 0 test failures allowed, 85-100% coverage on high-risk systems (combat/loot/inventory/player)
- Manual gates: Architecture review (no Console.Write, no hardcoded Random, Player encapsulation), edge case validation, playtest validation
- Rejection criteria: Test failures, coverage drops, architectural violations, edge case regressions, null refs, soft-lock bugs

**C# Testing Patterns:**
- Arrange-Act-Assert structure (always)
- Theory + InlineData for parameterized tests (e.g., CommandParser input variations)
- Moq IDisplayService verification for critical messages ("LEVEL UP!", "You defeated")
- System.Text.Json fixtures for save/load testing (if feature added)
- Deterministic Random pattern: `new Random(42)` in tests, `rng ?? new Random()` in production
- Builder pattern for test data factories (PlayerBuilder, EnemyBuilder)
- FluentAssertions for readability: `result.Should().Be(CombatResult.Won)`

**Timeline Estimate:** 1.5-2 sprints
- Phase 1: Infrastructure (IDisplayService extraction, Random injection, test project setup) — 1 week
- Phase 2: Unit tests (CombatEngine, LootTable, InventoryManager, CommandParser) — 1 week
- Phase 3: Integration tests (DungeonGenerator, GameLoop) — 3-4 days
- Phase 4: Regression suite (WI-10 edge cases) — 2 days
- Phase 5: CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, dotnet test) — 1 day

**Blocking Dependencies:**
- Hill: IDisplayService interface extraction (1-2 hours)
- Barton: CombatEngine/LootTable Random injection (2-3 hours)
- Hill: Player encapsulation refactor (2-3 hours)

**Patterns Identified:**
- Dependency injection for testability: inject Random, IDisplayService, future IFileSystem/IClock
- Interface extraction for external dependencies: Console → IDisplayService, File → IFileSystem
- Optional parameter pattern for production defaults: `Random? rng = null` → `_rng = rng ?? new Random()`

## 📌 Team Update (2026-02-20): Phase Gates and Testing Infrastructure
**From Scribe** — Team decisions merged; phase dependencies confirmed:
- **Phase Structure:** Coulson's phase gates linked to Romanoff's test coverage thresholds. Testing work (Phase 1) unblocks architecture work (Phase 2) which unblocks features (Phase 3).
- **Infrastructure Priority:** IDisplayService extraction (Hill + Coulson) and Random injection (Coulson + Hill) are prerequisites for test harness. Romanoff can begin xUnit setup once these interfaces/injections in place.
- **Coverage Targets:** 70%+ code coverage required Phase 1→2 gate. CombatEngine, LootTable, InventoryManager = 100% coverage must-haves per testing strategy.

**Impact on Romanoff:** Confirmed xUnit + Moq + FluentAssertions stack (vs NUnit). Mocking strategy (IDisplayService + seeded Random) documented and agreed across team.

📌 Team update (2026-02-20): CI Quality Gate Infrastructure established — 70% code coverage threshold enforced by GitHub Actions. Test project framework fixed (net10.0 → net9.0).

### 2026-02-20: v3 Quality Planning - Test Coverage Gaps & Strategy

**Scope:** Post-v2 test inventory audit; identify coverage gaps; plan v3 testing infrastructure for character classes, shops, crafting systems.

**v2 Test Inventory:**
- **Test Classes:** 13 total (139 test methods)
- **Coverage by System:**
  - ✅ **Full coverage:** CombatEngine (12), CommandParser (14), DisplayService (17), EnemyFactory (17), GameLoop (20), InventoryManager (8), LootTable (8), DungeonGenerator (10), AbilityManager (20), PlayerManaTests (10)
  - ⚠️ **Partial coverage:** Player (7 tests, basic only), EnemyTests (5, stub only)
  - ❌ **Zero coverage:** AchievementSystem (96 LOC), SaveSystem (178 LOC), StatusEffectManager (84 LOC), EnemyConfig, ItemConfig, GameEvents, RunStats, Enemies (9 types × 29-62 LOC)

**Critical Coverage Gaps (v2):**
1. **StatusEffectManager:** No unit tests for poison/bleed/burn/stun/regen/slow application, duration tracking, immunity handling (Stone Golem), turn-start processing, effect removal. Risk: Combat balance broken by untested effect logic.
2. **AchievementSystem:** No tests for unlock conditions, persistence (JSON save), Glass Cannon/Untouchable/Hoarder/EliteHunter/SpeedRunner logic. Risk: Silent achievement unlock failures; save corruption.
3. **SaveSystem:** No tests for GameState serialization, room graph reconstruction, deserialization safety (HP validation, stat bounds, null safety). Risk: Save/load data loss; soft-locks on corrupted saves.
4. **Equipment System:** Player equipment slots (weapon/armor/accessory) exist but no tests for swap logic, stat bonuses, or unequip edge cases. Risk: Stat exploitation (equip multiple weapons).
5. **Enemy Variants (Elite 5% & Config Scaling):** Elite enemy generation logic untested; config-driven stat scaling untested. Risk: Balance breakage via config edits.

**Quality Risks for v3 Features:**
1. **Character Classes:** No base class for inheritance testing; type casting untested in combat/loot systems. Need polymorphic test patterns.
2. **Shops & Crafting:** New persistent state (inventory qty tracking, recipe manager); no SaveSystem integration tests yet. Need transaction semantics testing.
3. **New Systems:** Player encapsulation must be validated (no public setters); mutable shared state (config, events) risks race conditions in multithreaded logging. Need immutability/isolation tests.

**Recommended v3 Test Strategy:**

**Tier 1 - Foundation (High Risk, Must Test):**
- StatusEffectManager unit tests (all 6 effects, immunity, duration, removal)
- Equipment system unit tests (equip/unequip, stat bonuses, conflict detection)
- SaveSystem integration tests (serialize/deserialize, file safety, data validation)
- AchievementSystem unit tests (all 5 achievement conditions, unlock logic, persistence)

**Tier 2 - Infrastructure (New Systems):**
- Abstract base class pattern tests (for character classes)
- Shop system unit tests (buy/sell logic, inventory qty, gold validation)
- Crafting recipe validation tests (ingredient checks, output generation)
- Config hotload safety tests (no state mutation during reload)

**Tier 3 - Hardening (Edge Cases & Defensive Coding):**
- Boundary tests: negative HP in save, invalid stat values, circular room exits
- Input validation: negative gold, invalid equipment slot indices, recipe name injection
- Concurrency safety: GameEvents thread safety, shared config read/write locks
- Null safety: SaveSystem deserialization failure modes, missing achievements list

**Tier 4 - Integration (v2 Regressions):**
- Dead enemy cleanup (regression from WI-10)
- Flee-and-return combat state persistence
- Status effect interaction during combat (apply → combat → remove cycle)
- Level-up during combat + status effect application ordering

**Test Infrastructure for v3:**
- **Async support:** Xunit + async/await for file I/O tests (SaveSystem)
- **JSON fixtures:** System.Text.Json deserializer safety patterns; corrupt JSON handling
- **Time-based tests:** Duration-based effect removal (turn counter vs wall-clock time)
- **Factory patterns:** CharacterClassBuilder, ShopStateBuilder, RecipeBuilder for test data
- **Config injection:** IGameConfig interface for mocking config values

**Edge Case Inventory (v2 + v3 Risks):**
- Dead enemy cleanup (GP@WI-10)
- Flee-and-return HP persistence (by design, but test it)
- Save file corruption recovery (silent fail vs graceful error)
- Empty shop (no recipes, no items) edge case
- Inventory overflow on pickup (max items, max qty per slot)
- Negative stat calculations (Defense > Attack scenario)
- Status effect duration = 0 at apply time
- Elite enemy spawn without base enemy type defined in config

**Quality Gates (v3):**
- **Build gates:** 80%+ coverage on high-risk systems (StatusEffects, Equipment, SaveSystem, Achievements). No test failures block merge.
- **Manual gates:** Code review for SaveSystem file I/O (handles missing directory, permission errors); Equipment stat bonuses validated against balance spreadsheet; Config hotload tested with live game state.
- **Regression gates:** All WI-10 edge case tests pass; dead enemy cleanup regression test included in CI.
- **Rejection criteria:** Coverage drop, new system without tests, untested edge case causing crash/balance issue, SaveSystem deserialization failure.

**Effort Estimate:**
- StatusEffectManager tests: 4-6 hours (all 6 effects × multiple scenarios)
- SaveSystem tests: 6-8 hours (file I/O, deserialization, validation)
- AchievementSystem tests: 3-4 hours (5 conditions, persistence)
- Equipment system tests: 3-4 hours (equip/unequip, bonuses)
- v3 infrastructure (class hierarchy, shop, crafting): 10-12 hours across phases
- **Total v3 testing work estimate:** 26-34 hours across v3 phases

### 2026-02-20: Systems/ Pre-v3 Bug Hunt — 7 Bugs Identified

**Scope:** SaveSystem, AchievementSystem, RunStats, config loaders — persistence layer review for state corruption, double-unlock, unset fields, and loading failures.

**Review Method:**
- Static code analysis (no test execution)
- LINQ usage audit (SaveSystem.ListSaves sort order)
- Data flow tracing (RunStats field updates)
- Deserialization safety audit (SaveSystem validation, Player state bounds)
- Edge case analysis (status effects on dead entities, config directory missing)

**Bugs Found (6 valid, 1 retracted):**

**Critical:**
1. **SaveSystem.ListSaves() — OrderByDescending Sort Bug** (SaveSystem.cs:146)
   - `OrderByDescending(File.GetLastWriteTime)` sorts filename strings, not timestamps
   - Impact: Save file list mis-sorted if filenames don't match write-time order alphabetically
   - Fix: Apply `OrderByDescending` to full paths, not filenames

2. **RunStats.DamageDealt/DamageTaken Never Updated** (RunStats.cs:18,21 + CombatEngine.cs)
   - Fields declared but never incremented during combat
   - Impact: "Untouchable" achievement always unlocks (DamageTaken defaults to 0), stat display broken
   - Fix: Inject RunStats into CombatEngine, track damage in PerformPlayerAttack/PerformEnemyTurn

**High:**
3. **SaveSystem.LoadGame() — No Player State Validation** (SaveSystem.cs:79-132)
   - Deserialized Player bypasses encapsulation: HP > MaxHP, negative stats, Level < 1 all allowed
   - Impact: Save corruption/exploit editing breaks combat math, achievement integrity
   - Fix: Validate HP <= MaxHP, stats > 0, Level >= 1 after deserialization

**Medium:**
4. **ItemConfig/EnemyConfig.Load() — No Directory Handling** (ItemConfig.cs:64, EnemyConfig.cs:55)
   - Check `File.Exists()` but don't handle missing parent directory
   - Impact: `DirectoryNotFoundException` instead of clearer `FileNotFoundException` if Data/ missing
   - Fix: Improve error message to mention directory requirement

5. **StatusEffectManager.ProcessTurnStart() — No Dead Entity Check** (StatusEffectManager.cs:46-79)
   - Applies status effects to entities with HP <= 0, shows "effect wore off" on corpses
   - Impact: Cosmetic bug (death messages on dead entities); potential logic error if called post-death
   - Fix: Guard clause to skip processing if target HP <= 0

**Low:**
6. **SaveSystem — Redundant .ToList() on Items** (SaveSystem.cs:105)
   - `Items = roomData.Items.ToList()` creates defensive copy when Items is already a List<Item>
   - Impact: None (defensive copy is actually good practice); micro-optimization opportunity only
   - Fix: None required; defensive copy prevents shared-reference bugs

**Retracted:**
- **AchievementSystem.Evaluate() Double-Unlock** — False alarm. `LoadUnlocked() + savedNames.Contains()` correctly prevents double-unlocking. No bug exists.

**Critical Patterns Identified:**

1. **LINQ Ordering Anti-Pattern:** `collection.OrderByDescending(File.GetLastWriteTime)` when `collection` is strings, not paths. Must pass full path to lambda for file-based sorts.

2. **Deserialization Trust Violation:** Loading JSON directly into domain models without validation bypasses encapsulation. Always validate external data:
   - Bounds checks (HP <= MaxHP)
   - Positive constraints (Level >= 1, MaxHP > 0)
   - Logical invariants (Mana <= MaxMana)

3. **Event-Driven Stat Tracking Gap:** RunStats fields exist but no event hooks to populate them. GameLoop → CombatEngine → RunStats dependency chain broken. Options:
   - **Dependency Injection:** Pass RunStats to CombatEngine (invasive but correct)
   - **Event Subscription:** GameLoop subscribes to damage events (looser coupling, harder to test)
   - **Post-Combat Aggregation:** CombatEngine returns damage summary (requires API change)

4. **Status Effect Lifecycle Management:** StatusEffectManager doesn't check entity liveness before applying effects. Defensive pattern: guard clause at method entry (`if (HP <= 0) return`).

5. **Config Loader Error Handling:** ItemConfig/EnemyConfig don't match SaveSystem's defensive directory handling. SaveSystem creates missing directories; config loaders assume they exist. Inconsistent error UX.

**Blocking Issues for v3:**
- **BUG-4 (RunStats tracking):** Blocks achievement system integrity — "Untouchable" exploit renders achievement meaningless
- **BUG-2 (SaveSystem validation):** Blocks safe save/load — corruption or exploit editing breaks game state
- **BUG-1 (ListSaves sort):** Blocks quality-of-life — "most recent save" UI misleading

**Test Coverage Gaps Exposed:**
- No SaveSystem round-trip validation tests (corrupt JSON → InvalidDataException)
- No RunStats integration tests (combat → verify damage counters incremented)
- No SaveSystem.ListSaves() temporal ordering tests
- No StatusEffectManager death-check tests (poison damage on 1 HP entity)
- No config loader error message tests (missing directory vs missing file)

**Files Written:**
- `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/romanoff-systems-bugs.md` — comprehensive bug report with severity, reproduction, fix recommendations

**Key File Paths (Systems/):**
- `SaveSystem.cs` — JSON save/load, room graph serialization, LINQ sort bug
- `AchievementSystem.cs` — Achievement unlock logic (CORRECT, no bugs found)
- `RunStats.cs` — Stat tracking fields (DamageDealt/Taken never updated)
- `ItemConfig.cs`, `EnemyConfig.cs` — Config loaders (directory handling weak)
- `StatusEffectManager.cs` — Status effect tick processing (no dead-entity guard)
- `GameEvents.cs` — Event hub (no events for damage tracking)

**Architecture Observation:**
- **Persistence Layer Weak Points:** SaveSystem has no validation layer; trusts deserialized data implicitly. Missing "hydration validation" step between JSON → Model.
- **Telemetry Gap:** RunStats declared as data DTO but no instrumentation to populate it. Event-driven architecture (GameEvents) exists but underutilized for analytics.
- **Config vs Save Asymmetry:** SaveSystem defensively creates directories; config loaders assume existence. Inconsistent defensive coding standards.

### 2026-02-20: Pre-v3 Bug Hunt Session — Systems Quality Findings

📌 **Team update (2026-02-20):** Pre-v3 comprehensive bug hunt identified 47 critical issues. Systems audit found 7 critical issues in SaveSystem, RunStats, AchievementSystem, and StatusEffectManager:

**Critical Blockers (must fix before v3):**
1. **SaveSystem.ListSaves() Sort Error (CRITICAL):** OrderByDescending sorts filename strings, not timestamps — save list shows wrong "most recent" order
2. **SaveSystem Validation Missing (HIGH):** LoadGame() deserializes without validation — HP can exceed MaxHP, stats go negative, achievement exploits possible (Glass Cannon)
3. **RunStats Damage Tracking (CRITICAL):** DamageDealt/DamageTaken fields never incremented — "Untouchable" achievement always unlocks because DamageTaken defaults to 0, stat display shows zeros

**Medium Issues:**
- Config loaders missing directory error handling
- StatusEffectManager processes effects on dead entities (cosmetic but defensive coding violation)

**Recommended Fixes:** Inject RunStats into CombatEngine (fix damage tracking), add LoadGame() validation (prevent save corruption), correct OrderByDescending usage (UI quality-of-life).

— decided by Romanoff (from Systems Pre-v3 Bug Hunt)

### 2026-02-20: Tests for Issues #220 and #221

**Task:** Write tests for two follow-up issues from PR #218 ahead of Barton/Hill's fix merges.

**Deliverables:**
- Branch: `squad/220-221-tests`
- PR #225: test: edge cases for ColorizeDamage and equipment comparison alignment

**New Test Files:**
- `Dungnz.Tests/ColorizeDamageTests.cs` — 2 tests for `ColorizeDamage()` (private, tested via `FakeDisplayService.RawCombatMessages`)
- `Dungnz.Tests/ShowEquipmentComparisonAlignmentTests.cs` — 2 tests for `ConsoleDisplayService.ShowEquipmentComparison()` (Console captured via `IDisposable` pattern)

**Infrastructure Change:**
- Added `RawCombatMessages` list to `FakeDisplayService` — stores un-stripped (ANSI-intact) combat messages alongside the existing stripped `CombatMessages` list. Additive change, no existing tests affected.

**Test Results at time of commit:**
- `ColorizeDamage` tests: 2/2 PASS — Barton's fix (PR #220, `ReplaceLastOccurrence` via `LastIndexOf`) is already merged
- `ShowEquipmentComparison` alignment tests: 0/2 PASS (expected) — Hill's fix for item-name-row padding (Current/New lines are 40 chars, should be 41) is NOT yet merged. Tests will auto-pass once that PR lands.

**Discoveries Made:**
1. Barton's ColorizeDamage fix was already in the codebase — `ReplaceLastOccurrence` using `LastIndexOf` already present in `Engine/CombatEngine.cs`. Tests confirm and lock in the behavior.
2. The alignment bug in `ShowEquipmentComparison` was more nuanced than described:
   - The **stat rows** (Attack/Defense) were ALREADY correctly padded using `StripAnsiCodes`-aware dynamic padding — Hill's fix for those is already merged too
   - The **item name rows** (Current/New) use `{name,-27}` with a fixed 1-char shortfall — these render as 40-char lines against a 41-char border
   - My tests correctly detect the item-name row misalignment and will pass once that's fixed

**Key Pattern:** `FakeDisplayService.RawCombatMessages` is now available for any future tests that need to inspect ANSI formatting rather than plain text.

### 2026-02-22: Intro QA Assessment & Testability Planning

**Task:** Assess intro improvements from quality and testability standpoint. Review Program.cs intro logic, evaluate testing implications, identify edge cases, recommend architecture.

**Findings:**

**Critical Issues (Current Architecture):**
1. **Program.cs intro logic is untestable** — All game startup (lines 7-82) is top-level script with hardcoded `Console.ReadLine()` calls. Cannot provide test input or validate behavior without console I/O.
2. **No input validation** — Empty names, invalid difficulty/class selections silently fall back to defaults without error messages. Edge cases unknown (special chars, whitespace, overflow).
3. **Prestige loading has no error handling** — Side effect loaded globally; if prestige save corrupted, crash with no recovery.
4. **Seed generation unrecorded** — Random seed generated but not captured for verification; hard to test determinism contracts.
5. **Player creation is inline** — Stat modifications (class bonuses, prestige bonuses) done at script level; cannot test player creation in isolation.

**Edge Cases Identified (23 edge cases across 4 input types):**
- **Player name:** Empty, whitespace-only, 100+ chars, newlines/null chars
- **Difficulty:** Empty input, invalid selections (4+), negative values
- **Class:** Empty input, invalid selections (4+), floating-point input
- **Seed:** Overflow (int.MaxValue), negative seeds, very large numbers, non-numeric input
- **Player creation:** Class bonus making stat negative, prestige loading failures, MaxHP clamping edge cases

**Testing Infrastructure Assessment:**
- ✅ **FakeDisplayService** exists (Helpers/) — tracks all output in lists; can be reused for intro testing
- ✅ **Console capture pattern** documented (DisplayServiceTests.cs) — IDisposable + StringWriter for console output validation
- ✅ **Test pattern established** — Arrange-Act-Assert, FluentAssertions, Theory+InlineData for parameterized tests
- ⚠️ **FakeInputReader** — Must enhance or create to queue test input for intro sequence

**Architectural Recommendation:**

**Extract `IntroSequence` class** (testable orchestrator):
- Constructor: Inject `IDisplayService`, `IInputReader`, `IPrestigeProvider`
- Public method `Run(out int seed) → Player` — Orchestrates all intro steps, returns initialized player
- Private methods: `ValidateName()`, `SelectSeed()`, `SelectDifficulty()`, `SelectClass()`, `CreatePlayer()`
- Enables: Unit testing of each step independently, FakeDisplayService mocking, test input injection, validation testing

**New IDisplayService Methods (testability):**
- Add return-value methods: `string SelectSeed()`, `Difficulty SelectDifficulty()`, `PlayerClass SelectClass()`
- Separates "show menu" (void) from "get valid choice" (return)
- Decouples display testing from logic testing

**Recommended Test Coverage (Tier 1 = must-write):**
- 24+ test cases: name validation (4), seed selection (4), difficulty selection (4), class selection (4), player creation (5), integration (3)
- Theory+InlineData for parameterized edge cases
- Integration test: full intro flow with fake input → verify player returned with correct stats

**Quality Gate Recommendations:**
- BLOCKING: All Tier 1 tests pass (24 cases), no Console.ReadLine in intro logic, FakeDisplayService captures all output
- MERGE GATE: Tier 2 edge cases covered, silent fallbacks documented, player bounds-checking verified
- REJECT: Test failures, prestige load crash, stat validation skipped, seed overflow unhandled

**Timeline Impact:**
- Refactoring IntroSequence: 2-3 hours (Hill/Barton)
- Writing Tier 1 tests: 4-6 hours (Romanoff)
- Code review + final tests: 1 hour
- **Total: 7-10 hours** before new intro features can be safely added

**Files for Creation:**
- `Engine/IntroSequence.cs` — Orchestrator class (new)
- `Dungnz.Tests/IntroSequenceTests.cs` — Test harness (24+ tests)
- Update `Display/IDisplayService.cs` — Add 3 return-value methods
- Update `Display/ConsoleDisplayService.cs` — Implement new methods
- Refactor `Program.cs` (lines 7-82) — Replace with `new IntroSequence().Run()`

**Key Learning:**
**Top-level script is the enemy of testability.** Any complex logic (selection menus, validation, player creation) must be extracted to a class with injected dependencies. This is not over-engineering; it's the minimum required for regression safety as the intro grows.

## 2026-02-22: Team Decision Merge

📌 **Team update:** Intro QA strategy, edge case testing framework, and quality assurance patterns — decided by Romanoff (via comprehensive intro QA assessment). Decisions merged into `.ai-team/decisions.md` by Scribe.

📌 Team update (2026-02-22): Process alignment protocol established — all code changes require a branch and PR before any commits. See decisions.md for full protocol. No exceptions.

### 2026-02-22: Phase 2.1–2.4 Proactive Tests — TierDisplayTests.cs

**Task:** Write proactive tests for Phase 2.1–2.4 (loot-display-phase2 branch) before Hill's code lands.

**File Written:** `Dungnz.Tests/TierDisplayTests.cs`

**Test Count:** 16 tests total (11 pass on master today; 5 intentionally fail pending Phase 2.1/2.3)

**Tests by category:**

| Test | Status on master | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| `ShowLootDrop_CommonItem_DoesNotContainBrightCyan` | ✅ PASS | baseline |
| `ShowLootDrop_CommonItem_ItemNameNotPrecededByGreen` | ✅ PASS | baseline |
| `ShowLootDrop_UncommonItem_ItemNamePrecededByGreen` | ❌ FAIL | Phase 2.1 |
| `ShowLootDrop_RareItem_OutputContainsBrightCyan` | ❌ FAIL | Phase 2.1 |
| `ShowLootDrop_RareItem_ItemNamePrecededByBrightCyan` | ❌ FAIL | Phase 2.1 |
| `ShowInventory_CommonItem_NoBrightCyanInOutput` | ✅ PASS | baseline |
| `ShowInventory_RareItem_OutputContainsBrightCyan` | ❌ FAIL | Phase 2.1/2.3 |
| `ShowInventory_UncommonItem_ItemNamePrecededByGreen` | ❌ FAIL | Phase 2.1/2.3 |
| `FakeDisplayService_ShowLootDrop_RareItem_RecordsItemName` | ✅ PASS | baseline |
| `FakeDisplayService_ShowInventory_RareItem_RecordsInventoryCount` | ✅ PASS | baseline |
| `ShowLootDrop_EmptyItemName_DoesNotThrow` | ✅ PASS | edge case |
| `ShowLootDrop_NullItemName_DoesNotThrow` | ✅ PASS | edge case |
| `ShowInventory_EmptyInventory_DoesNotThrow` | ✅ PASS | edge case |
| `ShowLootDrop_AllTiers_DoNotThrow` (Theory ×3) | ✅ PASS | edge case |

**Phase 2.2 (ShowShop) and Phase 2.4 (ShowCraftRecipe):** Fully written but commented out — methods not yet on `IDisplayService`. Uncomment and adjust signatures when Hill's interface changes land.

**Key Technical Notes:**
- `BrightCyan` is not yet in `ColorCodes.cs`. Tests use local const `BrightCyanAnsi = "\u001b[96m"` (standard ANSI bright cyan). Once Hill adds `ColorCodes.BrightCyan`, update the constant to reference it.
- Tests check `{color}{itemName}` pattern specifically (not just "output contains green") to distinguish tier color from other greens (equipped [E] tag, stat values, etc.)
- `FakeDisplayService` strips ANSI — useless for color assertions. All ANSI checks must use `ConsoleDisplayService` with `Console.SetOut(StringWriter)` capture pattern.

## Learnings

### Test patterns for color/tier behavior

1. **Use ConsoleDisplayService + Console capture for ANSI assertions** — `FakeDisplayService` strips all ANSI codes before recording. For any test that needs to assert color codes (e.g., tier color wrapping item names), redirect `Console.Out` to a `StringWriter` and use `new ConsoleDisplayService()` directly. Use `[Collection("console-output")]` to prevent parallel runs from competing on stdout.

2. **Test the specific `{color}{itemName}` pattern, not just `{color}` presence** — Many existing display methods already emit `ColorCodes.Green` for equipped tags, health values, etc. Asserting `output.Contains(ColorCodes.Green)` is a weak signal. Asserting `output.Contains($"{ColorCodes.Green}ItemName")` confirms the colorization is specifically wrapping the intended content.

3. **Define a local constant for not-yet-added color codes** — When a color code doesn't exist yet in `ColorCodes.cs`, use a local `private const string BrightCyanAnsi = "\u001b[96m"` in the test class. Add a comment to replace with `ColorCodes.BrightCyan` once Hill adds it. This lets tests compile and run without waiting for the constant to be defined.

4. **Proactive test failure count = Phase gate signal** — The 5 failing tests in `TierDisplayTests.cs` are an exact checklist for Phase 2.1/2.3. When Hill's PR is reviewed, running `dotnet test --filter TierDisplay` should show exactly those 5 transitioning to green. If more tests fail, something regressed; if fewer, the implementation is incomplete.

5. **Comment-in pattern for interface-gated tests** — When tests depend on interface methods that don't exist yet (ShowShop, ShowCraftRecipe), wrap the entire test class in `/* ... */` with a header comment `// Requires Phase 2.x: MethodName`. This preserves the test logic in version control without breaking compilation. Add a TODO listing the expected method signature so Hill can align implementation.


### 2026-02-20: Phase 3 Proactive Tests — Looting UX Polish

**Task:** Write proactive tests targeting Phase 3 features before Hill's PR lands on feature/loot-display-phase3.
**File:** `Dungnz.Tests/Phase3LootPolishTests.cs` (17 tests, all passing)

**Branch status:** feature/loot-display-phase3 did not exist when task began. Hill had already merged Phase 3 production code (ConsoleDisplayService, IDisplayService) into the current branch. The test project had pre-existing build failures from the signature change; fixed TierDisplayTests.cs:390 (FluentAssertions named-arg error) so the project compiled cleanly.

**Tests written (by section):**

**3.1 Consumable Grouping (4 tests):**
- `ShowInventory_ThreeIdenticalPotions_ShowsTimesThreeMultiplier` — 3 same-name items → output contains `×3`
- `ShowInventory_DifferentNamedItems_StaySeparate` — different names don't group, no `×2`
- `ShowInventory_SinglePotion_ShowsNoMultiplier` — single item, no `×` badge
- `ShowInventory_EmptyInventory_ShowsNoGroupingArtifacts` — empty inventory, no stray `×`, shows "(empty)"

**3.2 Elite Loot Callout (5 tests):**
- `ShowLootDrop_IsEliteTrue_OutputContainsEliteLootDrop` — isElite:true → "ELITE LOOT DROP"
- `ShowLootDrop_IsEliteFalse_OutputContainsLootDropButNotElite` — isElite:false → "LOOT DROP", no "ELITE"
- `ShowLootDrop_UncommonItem_OutputContainsUncommonBadge` — tier badge shows "Uncommon"
- `ShowLootDrop_RareItem_OutputContainsRareBadge` — tier badge shows "Rare"
- `ShowLootDrop_CommonItem_OutputContainsCommonBadge` — tier badge shows "Common"

**3.3 Weight Warning (4 tests):**
- `ShowItemPickup_At85PercentWeight_ShowsWeightWarning` — 42/50 weight → ⚠ + "nearly full"
- `ShowItemPickup_At79PercentWeight_ShowsNoWeightWarning` — 39/50 weight → no ⚠
- `ShowItemPickup_AtExactly80PercentWeight_ShowsWeightWarning` — 40/50 weight (exactly 80%) → no ⚠ (strict `>` boundary, not `>=`)
- `ShowItemPickup_AtJustOver80PercentWeight_ShowsWeightWarning` — 41/50 weight (82%) → ⚠

**3.4 New Best Indicator (4 tests):**
- `ShowLootDrop_NewWeaponBetterThanEquipped_ShowsPositiveDelta` — Attack +5 drop vs +2 equipped → "+3 vs equipped"
- `ShowLootDrop_NewWeaponSameAsEquipped_ShowsNoVsEquipped` — Attack +5 drop vs +5 equipped → no "vs equipped"
- `ShowLootDrop_NewWeaponWeakerThanEquipped_ShowsNoVsEquipped` — Attack +3 drop vs +5 equipped → no "vs equipped"
- `ShowLootDrop_PlayerHasNoWeaponEquipped_ShowsNoVsEquipped` — no weapon equipped → no "vs equipped"

**Key implementation observations:**
- `ShowInventory` groups by `GroupBy(i => i.Name)`, shows `×{count}` only when count > 1
- `ShowLootDrop(Item, Player, bool isElite)` already in production; uses `ColorCodes.Yellow` for elite header, tier switch for badge
- `ShowItemPickup` uses strict `>` (not `>=`) for the 80% weight boundary — exactly 80% does NOT trigger warning
- "vs equipped" indicator: only when `AttackBonus > 0 && EquippedWeapon != null && delta > 0`

**Patterns learned:**
- Boundary test important: the `>0.8` vs `>=0.8` distinction at exactly-80% is a common off-by-one risk; documented both sides in tests
- `EquippedWeapon` can be set directly (`player.EquippedWeapon = equippedSword`) without going through `Equip()` — valid for unit tests
- All 17 tests pass against existing production code with no mocking needed

### 2026-02-22: Phase 0 + Phase 1 Display Test Coverage (#301)

**Task:** Write comprehensive test coverage for merged Phase 0 (ANSI-safe padding) and Phase 1 (colorized combat messages, XP feedback, ability confirmation, immunity feedback).

**Branch:** `squad/301-phase1-tests`
**PR:** https://github.com/AnthonyMFuller/Dungnz/pull/301

**File Written:** `Dungnz.Tests/Phase1DisplayTests.cs` (10 tests total, all passing)

**Tests by category:**

**Phase 0: ANSI-Safe Padding (2 tests):**
- `ShowLootDrop_ColorizedTier_BoxBordersAlign` (Theory × Rare/Uncommon) — Tests that colorized tier labels don't break box border alignment. Verifies `VisibleLength` and `PadRightVisible` helpers indirectly by checking all border lines have the same visible length after stripping ANSI codes.
- `ShowInventory_ColorizedItems_AlignCorrectly` — Tests that inventory lines with colorized item names maintain proper alignment. Checks weight indicator appears in consistent format via regex.

**Phase 1.4: Colorized Turn Log (3 tests):**
- `CombatEngine_CriticalHit_ProducesColorizedMessage` — Forces crit with ControlledRandom(0.01), verifies raw combat messages contain Yellow/BrightRed/Bold ANSI codes
- `CombatEngine_Miss_ProducesGrayColoredMessage` — Forces dodge with ControlledRandom(0.01), verifies raw combat messages contain Gray color codes
- `CombatEngine_StatusEffectApplied_MessageContainsEffectColor` — Player with 100% poison weapon, verifies "Poison" appears in combat messages

**Phase 1.6: XP Progress Messages (2 tests):**
- `CombatEngine_AfterWinningCombat_ShowsXPProgress` — Verifies XP progress message contains "XP", "Total:", and "to next level"
- `CombatEngine_XPProgressMessage_ContainsCorrectValues` — Starts with 80 XP, gains 15, verifies message shows "15 XP" and "95"

**Phase 1.7: Ability Confirmation (2 tests):**
- `CombatEngine_AbilityUsed_ShowsConfirmationMessage` — Mage with ability, input "S", "1", "F", verifies "activated" appears in messages
- `CombatEngine_AbilityUsed_MessageContainsAbilityName` — Warrior with ability, verifies ability name appears in confirmation message

**Phase 1.8: Immunity Feedback (1 test):**
- `CombatEngine_ImmunityFeedback_MessageAppears` — Player with poison weapon vs Stone Golem (immune), verifies "immune" appears in messages

**Key Technical Patterns:**

1. **Testing private static helpers indirectly** — `RenderBar`, `VisibleLength`, `PadRightVisible` are private static in DisplayService. Can't test by name, so test them via their call sites (ShowLootDrop, ShowInventory, ShowCombatStatus). Verify box alignment by checking all border lines have consistent visible length after ANSI stripping.

2. **Capturing ANSI codes before stripping** — `FakeDisplayService.RawCombatMessages` field added to capture raw messages before ANSI stripping. This lets tests verify colorization without checking the stripped message list. For ShowLootDrop/ShowInventory, use `ConsoleDisplayService` with `Console.SetOut(StringWriter)` pattern.

3. **Forcing specific combat outcomes** — Use `ControlledRandom(defaultDouble: 0.01)` to force crits (< 0.05 threshold) or dodges. Use 100% status effect chance on weapons to guarantee application. Use Stone Golem for immunity tests (IsImmuneToEffects = true).

4. **Ability testing requires class + level** — Player needs `PlayerClass = Mage/Warrior/Rogue` and `Level >= 3` to have abilities. Use `AbilityManager.GetAbilitiesForClass()` to populate `LearnedAbilities`. Input sequence: "S" (ability menu), "1" (first ability), "F" (flee to end combat early).

5. **XP progress message appears in Messages, not CombatMessages** — After combat ends, XP feedback goes to `ShowMessage()`, which FakeDisplayService records in `Messages` list. Combat log entries go to `CombatMessages`. Know which list to check for each feature.

**Test Status:** ✅ All 10 tests pass
**Build Status:** ✅ Build succeeds (24 XML doc warnings pre-existing)
**Coverage Gaps:** None identified — all Phase 0 and Phase 1 display features covered

**PR Status:** Open, awaiting review
