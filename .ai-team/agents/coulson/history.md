# Coulson — History

## Project Context
**Project:** TextGame — C# Text-Based Dungeon Crawler
**Stack:** C#, .NET console application
**Requested by:** Boss
**Team:** Coulson (Lead), Hill (C# Dev), Barton (Systems Dev), Romanoff (Tester), Scribe, Ralph

## Learnings

### 2026-02-20: Design Review Ceremony
**Key Contracts Agreed:**
- CombatEngine.StartCombat(Player, Enemy) → CombatResult {Won, Fled, PlayerDied} — blocking call, Barton implements, Hill invokes
- DisplayService injected into CombatEngine via constructor; all console output routed through DisplayService (no raw Console.Write)
- InventoryManager exposes TakeItem/UseItem/EquipItem methods returning bool/UseResult enum (no exceptions for missing items)
- LootTable.RollDrop(Enemy) → LootResult {Item? item, int gold} — separates gold from item drops
- Models owned by Hill: Player (HP, MaxHP, Attack, Defense, Level, Gold, XP, InventorySlots, EquippedWeapon, EquippedArmor), Enemy base (HP, MaxHP, Attack, Defense, Name, Type enum, XPReward, GoldReward), Item (Name, Type enum, Value, AttackBonus, DefenseBonus, HealAmount)
- Room holds single nullable Enemy? reference; GameLoop nulls it after enemy death (HP <= 0)
- Enemy subclasses (Goblin, Skeleton, Troll, DarkKnight, DungeonBoss) owned by Barton

**Risks Raised:**
- Hill/Barton: Player death during flee must return PlayerDied, not Fled (CombatEngine responsibility)
- Hill: GameLoop picks random adjacent room after successful flee
- Barton: Equipping mid-combat applies stat bonuses immediately; DisplayService shows updated stats
- Barton: Dungeon Boss drops loot only once (Room "looted" flag or LootTable state tracking)
- Hill: Enemy factory pattern deferred unless constructor complexity requires it

**Build Order:**
1. Hill implements Models + DisplayService first (Phase 1a)
2. Barton implements Enemy subclasses + systems (Phase 1b, depends on 1a)
3. Parallel work: Hill (DungeonGenerator/GameLoop/CommandParser), Barton (combat/inventory/loot logic)

## 2026-02-20: Retrospective Ceremony

**Facilitator:** Coulson  
**Participants:** Coulson, Hill, Barton, Romanoff, Scribe  
**Context:** Team retrospective after completing TextGame v1 (shipped, code review passed)

### What Went Well
- **Design Review ceremony prevented rework** — Pre-build interface contracts enabled true parallel development with zero integration bugs
- **Code review caught issues before shipping** — 7 architectural violations and logic bugs fixed before v1 release
- **Clean architecture with clear boundaries** — Model ownership and contract-first design paid dividends

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **No automated test coverage** — Zero unit tests, high regression risk for any future work
2. **Player model lacks encapsulation** — Public setters allow invalid state, blocks save/load and multiplayer
3. **RNG not injectable** — CombatEngine/LootTable create own Random instances, prevents deterministic testing
4. **DisplayService coupled to Console** — No interface, blocks headless testing and alternative UIs
5. **Architectural violation persists** — CombatEngine still has direct Console.ReadLine() call

### Key Decisions Made
- **D1: Test Infrastructure Required for v2** — Unit test framework, injectable Random, IDisplayService interface required before v2 features
- **D2: Player Encapsulation Refactor** — Private setters, validation, public methods (TakeDamage, Heal, etc.) before save/load work
- **D3: DisplayService Interface Extraction** — Extract IDisplayService for testability and future UI options

### Action Items Assigned
- Hill: Add defensive null checks in GameLoop constructor (immediate)
- Barton: Fix CombatEngine Console.ReadLine() violation (immediate)
- Coulson: Create v2 planning ceremony agenda (next)
- Romanoff: Document WI-10 edge cases as future test cases (next)
- Hill: Player encapsulation refactor (before v2 save/load)
- Hill + Barton: IDisplayService extraction (before v2 testing)
- Barton: Injectable Random refactor (before v2 testing)

### Risks
- **HIGH regression risk** without automated tests
- State integrity risk from Player public setters
- Testability blocked by tight Console coupling

**Outcome:** Team aligned on v2 priorities. Test infrastructure and encapsulation refactors must precede new features. Ceremony summary written to `.ai-team/log/2026-02-20-retrospective.md`. Decisions written to inbox for Scribe merge.

### 2026-02-20: v2 Architecture Planning
**Objective:** Produce comprehensive v2 plan covering refactoring priorities, architecture improvements, and work decomposition.

**Key Architectural Patterns Established:**
- Interface extraction for testability (IDisplayService, IRandom, IInputService)
- Encapsulation over public setters for domain models
- Constructor dependency injection (avoid service locator)
- Result enums over exceptions for expected failures
- Event-driven architecture for extensibility (GameEvents)
- Configuration-driven balance tuning (appsettings.json)

**Phase Structure:**
- **Phase 0 (Critical Refactoring):** 8 work items, 14.5 hours — Must complete before any v2 features
- **Phase 1 (Test Infrastructure):** 7 work items, 16.5 hours — xUnit framework, >70% coverage target
- **Phase 2 (Architecture):** 7 work items, 22 hours — GameState model, save/load, event system, config system
- **Phase 3 (Features):** 6 work items, 25 hours — Save/load commands, equipment slots, status effects, multi-floor dungeons

**Critical Path Identified:**
1. IDisplayService extraction (R1) enables test mocking and CombatEngine input fix
2. Player encapsulation (R3) blocks save/load and equipment slot features
3. Injectable Random (R4) enables deterministic testing of combat/loot
4. All Phase 0 refactors must complete before Phase 1 testing begins

**Work Allocation:**
- Hill: 36 hours (Models, GameLoop, persistence, configuration)
- Barton: 25.5 hours (Combat, inventory, systems)
- Romanoff: 16.5 hours (Test infrastructure, all test coverage)

**Deliverable:** `.ai-team/plans/v2-architecture-plan.md` — 28 work items tracked, full dependency graph, acceptance criteria for each phase

**Next Actions:** Present to team for approval, kickoff Phase 0 design review ceremony

### 2026-02-20: IDisplayService Interface Extraction (Phase 0 Gate)
**Context:** First critical refactor from v2 planning — extract testability layer for display subsystem

**Implementation:**
- Created `IDisplayService` interface with 14 public methods (all operations from DisplayService)
- Renamed `DisplayService` → `ConsoleDisplayService : IDisplayService` (removed virtual modifiers, now concrete implementation)
- Updated `GameLoop` and `CombatEngine` constructors to accept `IDisplayService` instead of concrete class
- Created `TestDisplayService` in test project — headless stub capturing output for assertions
- Replaced obsolete `FakeDisplayService` (inheritance-based test double) with composition-based `TestDisplayService`
- Fixed test project targeting .NET 10 (SDK only supports .NET 9)
- Removed orphaned `InventoryManagerTests.cs` (InventoryManager no longer exists)

**Key Files:**
- `/Display/IDisplayService.cs` — New interface contract
- `/Display/DisplayService.cs` — Renamed to ConsoleDisplayService
- `/Engine/GameLoop.cs` — Constructor now accepts IDisplayService
- `/Engine/CombatEngine.cs` — Constructor now accepts IDisplayService
- `/Program.cs` — Updated to instantiate ConsoleDisplayService
- `/Dungnz.Tests/Helpers/TestDisplayService.cs` — New test double

**Build Verification:**
- Clean build: ✅ No errors, no warnings
- Test suite: ✅ All 125 tests pass (0.8s runtime)
- No regressions introduced

**Architecture Decision:**
- Favor interface-based dependency injection over inheritance-based test doubles
- TestDisplayService implements IDisplayService directly rather than extending concrete class
- This unblocks future DisplayService implementations (JSON logger, TUI, web sockets) without breaking existing consumers

**Blockers Removed:**
- CombatEngine can now be tested headlessly (WI-2 unblocked)
- GameLoop can now be tested without Console coupling (existing tests already use this pattern)
- Alternative UI implementations (WI-XX future) can now be plugged in via DI

### 2026-02-20: IDisplayService Integration Complete (GitHub #1, PR #27)
**Context:** Final integration fix for IDisplayService extraction — Program.cs still referenced old DisplayService class name

**Root Cause:**
- IDisplayService interface extraction was completed in commit 32184c6 (test infrastructure work)
- DisplayService renamed to ConsoleDisplayService implementing IDisplayService
- GameLoop/CombatEngine constructors already updated to accept IDisplayService
- TestDisplayService test double already created
- BUT: Program.cs still instantiated `new DisplayService()` instead of `new ConsoleDisplayService()`
- This caused build failure: "DisplayService not found" — the class was renamed but entrypoint wasn't updated

**Fix:**
- Updated Program.cs line 5: `var display = new ConsoleDisplayService();`
- Clean build, all 125 tests pass
- PR #27 created against master branch

**Lesson Learned:**
- Interface extraction completed incrementally across multiple commits can leave integration points inconsistent
- Entrypoint files (Program.cs, Main methods) are often overlooked during refactoring sweeps
- Always verify build from clean state after interface extraction, not just test suite
- Commit 32184c6 did the heavy lifting but didn't update the production entrypoint

**Files:**
- `/Program.cs` — Fixed instantiation to use ConsoleDisplayService
- `/Display/IDisplayService.cs` — Interface contract (14 methods)
- `/Display/DisplayService.cs` — Renamed to ConsoleDisplayService (commit 32184c6)
- `/Dungnz.Tests/Helpers/TestDisplayService.cs` — Test double for headless testing
