### 2026-02-20: Code review verdict
**By:** Romanoff  
**What:** WI-10 review outcome — feature-complete quality gate  
**Why:** Quality gate before v1 ships. Reviewed all 23 source files for bugs, logic errors, architectural violations, and edge cases.

**Verdict:** APPROVED ✓

**Issues Found & Fixed (7):**
1. **Architectural violation** — Program.cs used direct Console.Write/ReadLine instead of DisplayService
2. **Architectural violation** — GameLoop.cs used direct Console.Write("> ") for command prompt
3. **Architectural violation** — CombatEngine.cs used direct Console.Write("[A]ttack or [F]lee? ") for combat prompt
4. **Logic bug** — Dead enemies (HP=0) not cleared from room after combat victory, leaving Enemy!=null
5. **Logic inconsistency** — Win condition checked `HP<=0` instead of `Enemy==null`, creating dead-but-present enemy state
6. **Architecture enforcement** — Added ShowCommandPrompt(), ShowCombatPrompt(), ReadPlayerName() to DisplayService
7. **Lifecycle bug** — Fixed GameLoop to set `_currentRoom.Enemy = null` after CombatResult.Won

**Edge cases verified:**
- Empty inventory USE → handled (error message)
- GO with no argument → handled (error message)
- TAKE with no items in room → handled (error message)
- Combat with dead enemy (HP<=0, Enemy!=null) → FIXED (now impossible — enemy cleared on defeat)

**No blocking issues remain.**

**Commit:** eb99612 "fix: code review corrections (WI-10)"

**Rationale for APPROVED:**
- All architectural violations corrected (DisplayService now sole Console I/O owner)
- Logic bugs fixed (dead enemy cleanup ensures consistent state)
- Null safety verified (LootTable = null! safe — always initialized in constructors)
- Edge cases handled properly
- Code is production-ready

Code is ready to ship. No further revisions required.
