# Barton Phase 2 Decisions — Combat Systems

**Date:** 2024
**Agent:** Barton (Systems Dev)
**Work Items:** WI-6, WI-7, WI-8

## Decision 1: Flee Mechanic Penalty
**Decision:** Failed flee attempts result in enemy getting a free attack before returning to combat menu.
**Rationale:** Prevents flee spam, adds risk/reward to retreat decisions, maintains combat tension.
**Alternative Considered:** Simply denying flee and continuing turn — rejected as too lenient.

## Decision 2: Equipment Consumption Model
**Decision:** Weapons and Armor permanently increase stats and are removed from inventory when equipped.
**Rationale:** Simplified inventory management, no unequip mechanic needed for Phase 2.
**Future Consideration:** Could add equipment slots and unequip in later phases.

## Decision 3: Loot Drop First-Match-Wins
**Decision:** LootTable checks each drop probability sequentially; first success wins, no stacking.
**Rationale:** Simplifies loot logic, prevents complex multi-drop scenarios in early game.
**Trade-off:** Bosses with multiple drops must rely on high individual chances rather than multiple rolls.

## Decision 4: Level-Up Full Heal
**Decision:** Level up restores HP to new MaxHP value.
**Rationale:** Rewards progression, prevents dying immediately after level up, feels satisfying.
**Balance Note:** Combined with +10 MaxHP per level, player scales well against late-game enemies.

## Decision 5: Enemy Stat Curve
**Decision:** Enemy progression follows: Goblin (20 HP) → Skeleton (30) → Troll (60) → Dark Knight (45) → Boss (100).
**Rationale:** 
- Goblin: early game fodder
- Skeleton: first threat
- Troll: HP tank teaches attrition
- Dark Knight: high offense/defense, mid-boss feel
- Boss: 2.5x HP of Dark Knight, guards exit
**Note:** Dark Knight lower HP than Troll but much higher threat via ATK/DEF.
