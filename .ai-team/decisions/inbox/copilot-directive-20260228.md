### 2026-02-28: User directive — implementation work completion gate
**By:** Anthony (via Copilot)
**What:** Implementation work is never complete if there are open Issues or PRs that relate to the work being done. The team must check for and resolve all related open Issues and PRs before declaring any task done.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory to prevent premature task completion declarations
