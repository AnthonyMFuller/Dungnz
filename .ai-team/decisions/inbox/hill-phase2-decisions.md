# Hill Phase 2 Design Decisions

**Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Author:** Hill (C# Dev)  
**Work Items:** WI-3, WI-4

## Decision 1: Room Graph Architecture

**Context:** Needed to create a procedurally generated dungeon with guaranteed paths.

**Decision:** Implemented 5x4 grid (20 rooms) with bidirectional connections via Dictionary<Direction, Room> stored directly in Room.Exits.

**Rationale:**
- Grid structure guarantees connectivity (no isolated rooms)
- Bidirectional linking ensures players can backtrack
- Dictionary<Direction, Room> allows O(1) exit lookup in GameLoop
- BFS validation provides safety check (though redundant with full grid)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Tree structure (rejected: no loops, limited exploration)
- Graph with random connections (rejected: complexity, possible dead ends)

## Decision 2: ICombatEngine Interface

**Context:** GameLoop needs combat but Barton owns combat implementation.

**Decision:** Created ICombatEngine interface with single method: `CombatResult RunCombat(Player, Enemy)`.

**Rationale:**
- Clean separation of concerns: Hill owns game loop, Barton owns combat
- Allows parallel development (stub for testing, real impl swaps in)
- GameLoop doesn't know or care about combat internals (attack rolls, flee logic, loot drops)
- Dependency injection via constructor makes testing possible

**Interface Contract:**
```csharp
public interface ICombatEngine
{
    CombatResult RunCombat(Player player, Enemy enemy);
}
```

**Impact:** Barton delivered CombatEngine in parallel; integration was trivial (one line change in Program.cs).

## Decision 3: Command Parsing Strategy

**Context:** Need to parse diverse player input (full commands, shortcuts, directions).

**Decision:** Single-pass parser with switch expression on normalized input. Supports aliases (n/s/e/w, i, h/?, q).

**Rationale:**
- Simple and fast: O(1) lookup via switch
- Extensible: new commands added as switch cases
- Case-insensitive for better UX
- Returns structured ParsedCommand (type + argument) for type-safe dispatch

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Regex patterns (rejected: overkill, harder to maintain)
- Command pattern with classes (rejected: too heavyweight for this scale)

---

## Decision 4: Item Usage Semantics

**Context:** Players need to use consumables (heal) and equip gear (weapons/armor).

**Decision:** HandleUse implements:
- Consumables: Apply HealAmount, cap at MaxHP, remove from inventory
- Equippables: Add stat bonuses permanently to player, remove from inventory (single-use equip)

**Rationale:**
- Simple mental model: use = consume/equip, item is removed
- No equipment slot management (out of scope for MVP)
- Stat bonuses stack (multiple weapons/armor allowed)

**Trade-offs:**
- No unequip mechanic (future enhancement)
- No equipment slot limits (could stack infinite items)
- Accepted for MVP; easily extended later if needed

## Decision 5: Win/Lose Conditions

**Context:** Game needs clear victory and defeat states.

**Decision:**
- **Win:** Player enters exit room (`IsExit == true`) AND boss is dead (`Enemy == null || Enemy.HP <= 0`)
- **Lose:** `CombatResult.PlayerDied` returned from combat
- **Boss guard:** Cannot enter exit room if boss is alive (enforced in HandleGo)

**Rationale:**
- Boss fight is mandatory (aligns with "dungeon crawler" genre)
- Clear feedback: game ends immediately on win/lose
- Boss guard prevents sequence breaking (can't skip final fight)

**Implementation:** Checked in two places:
1. HandleGo: Block movement to exit if boss alive
2. HandleGo: After moving to exit, check win condition

---

## Decision 6: EnemyFactory Stub Pattern

**Context:** DungeonGenerator needs enemies, but Barton is implementing enemy classes in parallel.

**Decision:** Created EnemyFactory with internal stub classes (GoblinStub, SkeletonStub, etc.) that compile immediately.

**Rationale:**
- Allows Hill to finish WI-3/WI-4 without waiting for Barton
- Stubs have correct Enemy inheritance and basic stats
- Barton's real classes (Systems/Enemies/) can replace stubs transparently
- Factory pattern centralizes enemy creation logic

**Outcome:** Barton delivered real enemy classes in parallel commit. Stubs remain in code but are unused. Factory now returns real instances.

---

## Decision 7: Automatic Combat Trigger

**Context:** When should combat start?

**Decision:** Combat triggers automatically when player enters room with living enemy. Called immediately in HandleGo after room transition.

**Rationale:**
- Simplifies game flow (no "attack" command needed while moving)
- Aligns with classic dungeon crawler behavior (Zork, NetHack)
- Prevents "run past enemies" exploit

**Alternative Considered:** Manual attack command (rejected: adds micromanagement, less immersive)

## Notes for Scribe

These decisions are stable and can be merged to main decisions.md. All contracts (ICombatEngine, CommandType, ParsedCommand) are finalized and used by both Hill and Barton's code.
