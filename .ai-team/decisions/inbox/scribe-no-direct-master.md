### 2026-02-22: No commits directly to master
**By:** Anthony (via Copilot coordinator)
**What:** All work — whether triggered by a GitHub issue or an open-ended request — must be done on a feature branch. No commits may land directly on master. Branches should follow the naming convention squad/{slug} or squad/{issue-number}-{slug}. Work reaches master only via PR review and merge.
**Why:** The squad committed UI/UX implementation work directly to master during a session where no GitHub issue was present, bypassing the branch/PR workflow.
