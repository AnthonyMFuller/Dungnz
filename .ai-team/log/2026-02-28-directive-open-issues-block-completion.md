# Session Log: 2026-02-28

## Requested by
Anthony

## Directive Captured
Anthony issued a standing directive: implementation work is never complete if there are open issues or PRs related to the work being done.

Coordinator captured this to the decisions inbox as `copilot-directive-20260228.md`.

## Summary
This directive ensures the team verifies all related GitHub Issues and Pull Requests are resolved before marking any implementation work as complete. Prevents duplicate issues and stale PRs from remaining outstanding.
