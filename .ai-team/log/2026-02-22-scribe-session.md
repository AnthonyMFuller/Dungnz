# Scribe Session — 2026-02-22

**Requested by:** Copilot

## Work Done

1. **Merged decision inbox files** — 10 files from `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/`:
   - `coulson-pr223-review.md`
   - `coulson-pr224-review.md`
   - `coulson-pr225-review.md`
   - `coulson-pr226-review.md`
   - `barton-intro-flow-ux-recommendations.md`
   - `barton-intro-systems-design.md`
   - `coulson-intro-sequence-architecture.md`
   - `hill-intro-display-design.md`
   - `hill-intro-sequence-extraction.md`
   - `romanoff-intro-qa-notes.md`

2. **Deduplicated decisions.md** — Consolidated overlapping decision blocks across 10 newly merged files:
   - Identified groups of related decisions covering same topics/components
   - Synthesized consolidated blocks with merged intent and rationale
   - Removed redundant overlapping entries
   - Preserved unique insights from each author

3. **Propagated team updates** — Appended decision summaries to affected agent history files:
   - Coulson: 1 update (sequence architecture and PR reviews)
   - Hill: 1 update (display design and sequence extraction)
   - Barton: 1 update (intro flow UX and systems design)
   - Romanoff: 1 update (QA notes and testing strategy)

4. **Archived history when needed** — Checked agent history files:
   - No files exceeded 3,000 tokens; all below archival threshold

5. **Committed all `.ai-team/` changes** — Single commit with all updates
