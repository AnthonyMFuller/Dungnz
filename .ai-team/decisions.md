### 2026-02-20: Design Review decisions
**By:** Coulson  
**What:** Pre-build interface contracts agreed by Hill and Barton  
**Why:** Ceremony before Phase 1 — prevents rework from contract mismatches

#### Agreed Contracts and Decisions

1. **CombatEngine Contract**
   - `CombatEngine.StartCombat(Player, Enemy) → CombatResult {Won, Fled, PlayerDied}`
   - Blocking synchronous call; Hill's GameLoop invokes and handles result
   - CombatEngine receives DisplayService via constructor (Hill instantiates both)

2. **DisplayService Contract**
   - Hill exposes: `ShowCombatStatus(Player, Enemy)`, `ShowCombatMessage(string)`, `ShowInventory(Player)`, `ShowLootDrop(Item)`
   - Rule: ALL console output routed through DisplayService (no raw Console.Write in Barton's code)

3. **Inventory System Contract**
   - Barton exposes: `TakeItem(Player, Item) → bool`, `UseItem(Player, string) → UseResult`, `EquipItem(Player, string) → bool`, `GetInventorySummary(Player) → IReadOnlyList<Item>`
   - UseResult enum: Success, NotFound, InvalidContext (no exceptions for missing items)

4. **LootTable Contract**
   - `LootTable.RollDrop(Enemy) → LootResult { Item? item, int gold }`
   - Separates gold from item drops; caller adds gold to Player.Gold

5. **Model Ownership**
   - Hill defines: Player, Enemy (base), Item, Room, Direction, CombatResult, UseResult, LootResult
   - Barton defines: 5 Enemy subclasses (Goblin, Skeleton, Troll, DarkKnight, DungeonBoss)
   - Player fields: HP, MaxHP, Attack, Defense, Level, Gold, XP, InventorySlots (List<Item>), EquippedWeapon (Item?), EquippedArmor (Item?)
   - Enemy fields: HP, MaxHP, Attack, Defense, Name, Type (enum), XPReward, GoldReward (no IsAlive flag; death = HP <= 0)
   - Item fields: Name, Type (enum: Weapon/Armor/Consumable), Value, AttackBonus, DefenseBonus, HealAmount

6. **Room Enemy Storage**
   - Room holds single nullable `Enemy?` reference (not list)
   - CombatEngine sets `enemy.HP = 0` on death; GameLoop nulls Room.Enemy after combat

7. **Stat Application**
   - Equipping weapon/armor applies Attack/Defense bonuses immediately
   - InventoryManager mutates Player.Attack/Defense when equipping

8. **Dungeon Boss**
   - Spawned once by DungeonGenerator, guards exit room
   - Drops loot only on first death (Room tracks "looted" flag or LootTable checks state)

9. **Player Death Handling**
   - CombatEngine returns `CombatResult.PlayerDied`
   - GameLoop handles game-over display and exit (Barton does NOT call Environment.Exit)

10. **Flee Penalty Edge Case**
    - If flee penalty kills player, result is `PlayerDied`, not `Fled`
    - GameLoop picks random adjacent room after successful flee

#### Build Order
- **Phase 1a (Hill):** Models, enums, DisplayService interface
- **Phase 1b (Barton, depends on 1a):** Enemy subclasses, CombatEngine, InventoryManager, LootTable
- **Phase 2 (Parallel):** Hill builds DungeonGenerator/GameLoop/CommandParser; Barton completes systems

# Hill — Phase 1 Design Decisions

**Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Agent:** Hill  
**Work Items:** WI-1 (Scaffold), WI-2 (Core Models)

---

## Decision 1: Item Field Completeness
**Context:** Design Review specified 7 fields for Item, but some overlap (StatModifier vs AttackBonus/DefenseBonus).

**Decision:** Included all fields (StatModifier, AttackBonus, DefenseBonus, HealAmount) in Item class.

**Rationale:**
- Provides flexibility for Barton's systems to use either simple (StatModifier) or granular (AttackBonus/DefenseBonus) approaches
- Avoids future refactoring if requirements evolve
- Minimal cost (4 extra bytes per Item instance)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Remove StatModifier and use only AttackBonus/DefenseBonus → Rejected: Design Review explicitly listed all fields
- Use only StatModifier → Rejected: Less expressive for complex items (e.g., item that boosts attack but reduces defense)

---

## Decision 2: LootTable Placement
**Context:** LootTable is implemented by Barton but needs to be a property on Enemy (Hill's model).

**Decision:** Placed LootTable class in Models/ folder with placeholder RollDrop method.

**Rationale:**
- Shared type across Hill's (Enemy.LootTable property) and Barton's (RollDrop implementation) domains
- Avoids circular reference if placed in Systems/ (Models would reference Systems)
- Barton can replace stub implementation without moving the class

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Abstract base class in Models/, concrete impl in Systems/ → Rejected: Over-engineered for simple loot logic
- Interface ILootTable in Models/ → Rejected: Adds boilerplate without value (no polymorphism needed)

---

## Decision 3: DisplayService Method Naming
**Context:** Design Review specified ShowCombatStatus and ShowCombatMessage for CombatEngine integration.

**Decision:** Used exact method names from Design Review contract.

**Rationale:**
- Barton can implement CombatEngine without waiting for Hill to clarify naming
- Reduces integration friction (no "which method do I call?" questions)
- Naming is clear and consistent (ShowX pattern for all display methods)

---

## Decision 4: Room.Looted Flag
**Context:** Boss loot should drop only once; Design Review mentioned Room.Looted flag OR LootTable state tracking.

**Decision:** Added Looted flag to Room model.

**Rationale:**
- Simpler than LootTable maintaining per-enemy state across rooms
- Room already has Visited flag; Looted is parallel concept
- GameLoop can check Room.Looted before calling LootTable.RollDrop

**Alternatives Considered:**
- LootTable tracks dropped state per Enemy instance → Rejected: Requires LootTable to store stateful data (breaks stateless design)
- No loot deduplication → Rejected: Boss farming would break game balance

---

## Non-Decisions (Deferred to Barton)
- Enemy subclass implementations (Goblin, Skeleton, Troll, DarkKnight, DungeonBoss)
- LootTable.RollDrop logic (drop rates, random selection)
- InventoryManager implementation (TakeItem, UseItem, EquipItem)
- CombatEngine.StartCombat implementation (turn order, damage calculation, flee mechanics)

---

**Approval:** Self-approved (within Hill's charter scope)  
**Status:** Implemented in commit 5c0901c

# Barton Phase 2 Decisions — Combat Systems

**Date:** 2024
**Agent:** Barton (Systems Dev)
**Work Items:** WI-6, WI-7, WI-8

## Decision 1: Flee Mechanic Penalty
**Decision:** Failed flee attempts result in enemy getting a free attack before returning to combat menu.
**Rationale:** Prevents flee spam, adds risk/reward to retreat decisions, maintains combat tension.
**Alternative Considered:** Simply denying flee and continuing turn — rejected as too lenient.

## Decision 2: Equipment Consumption Model
**Decision:** Weapons and Armor permanently increase stats and are removed from inventory when equipped.
**Rationale:** Simplified inventory management, no unequip mechanic needed for Phase 2.
**Future Consideration:** Could add equipment slots and unequip in later phases.

## Decision 3: Loot Drop First-Match-Wins
**Decision:** LootTable checks each drop probability sequentially; first success wins, no stacking.
**Rationale:** Simplifies loot logic, prevents complex multi-drop scenarios in early game.
**Trade-off:** Bosses with multiple drops must rely on high individual chances rather than multiple rolls.

## Decision 4: Level-Up Full Heal
**Decision:** Level up restores HP to new MaxHP value.
**Rationale:** Rewards progression, prevents dying immediately after level up, feels satisfying.
**Balance Note:** Combined with +10 MaxHP per level, player scales well against late-game enemies.

## Decision 5: Enemy Stat Curve
**Decision:** Enemy progression follows: Goblin (20 HP) → Skeleton (30) → Troll (60) → Dark Knight (45) → Boss (100).
**Rationale:** 
- Goblin: early game fodder
- Skeleton: first threat
- Troll: HP tank teaches attrition
- Dark Knight: high offense/defense, mid-boss feel
- Boss: 2.5x HP of Dark Knight, guards exit
**Note:** Dark Knight lower HP than Troll but much higher threat via ATK/DEF.

# Hill Phase 2 Design Decisions

**Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Author:** Hill (C# Dev)  
**Work Items:** WI-3, WI-4

## Decision 1: Room Graph Architecture

**Context:** Needed to create a procedurally generated dungeon with guaranteed paths.

**Decision:** Implemented 5x4 grid (20 rooms) with bidirectional connections via Dictionary<Direction, Room> stored directly in Room.Exits.

**Rationale:**
- Grid structure guarantees connectivity (no isolated rooms)
- Bidirectional linking ensures players can backtrack
- Dictionary<Direction, Room> allows O(1) exit lookup in GameLoop
- BFS validation provides safety check (though redundant with full grid)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Tree structure (rejected: no loops, limited exploration)
- Graph with random connections (rejected: complexity, possible dead ends)

---

## Decision 2: ICombatEngine Interface

**Context:** GameLoop needs combat but Barton owns combat implementation.

**Decision:** Created ICombatEngine interface with single method: `CombatResult RunCombat(Player, Enemy)`.

**Rationale:**
- Clean separation of concerns: Hill owns game loop, Barton owns combat
- Allows parallel development (stub for testing, real impl swaps in)
- GameLoop doesn't know or care about combat internals (attack rolls, flee logic, loot drops)
- Dependency injection via constructor makes testing possible

**Interface Contract:**
```csharp
public interface ICombatEngine
{
    CombatResult RunCombat(Player player, Enemy enemy);
}
```

**Impact:** Barton delivered CombatEngine in parallel; integration was trivial (one line change in Program.cs).

---

## Decision 3: Command Parsing Strategy

**Context:** Need to parse diverse player input (full commands, shortcuts, directions).

**Decision:** Single-pass parser with switch expression on normalized input. Supports aliases (n/s/e/w, i, h/?, q).

**Rationale:**
- Simple and fast: O(1) lookup via switch
- Extensible: new commands added as switch cases
- Case-insensitive for better UX
- Returns structured ParsedCommand (type + argument) for type-safe dispatch

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Regex patterns (rejected: overkill, harder to maintain)
- Command pattern with classes (rejected: too heavyweight for this scale)

---

## Decision 4: Item Usage Semantics

**Context:** Players need to use consumables (heal) and equip gear (weapons/armor).

**Decision:** HandleUse implements:
- Consumables: Apply HealAmount, cap at MaxHP, remove from inventory
- Equippables: Add stat bonuses permanently to player, remove from inventory (single-use equip)

**Rationale:**
- Simple mental model: use = consume/equip, item is removed
- No equipment slot management (out of scope for MVP)
- Stat bonuses stack (multiple weapons/armor allowed)

**Trade-offs:**
- No unequip mechanic (future enhancement)
- No equipment slot limits (could stack infinite items)
- Accepted for MVP; easily extended later if needed

---

## Decision 5: Win/Lose Conditions

**Context:** Game needs clear victory and defeat states.

**Decision:**
- **Win:** Player enters exit room (`IsExit == true`) AND boss is dead (`Enemy == null || Enemy.HP <= 0`)
- **Lose:** `CombatResult.PlayerDied` returned from combat
- **Boss guard:** Cannot enter exit room if boss is alive (enforced in HandleGo)

**Rationale:**
- Boss fight is mandatory (aligns with "dungeon crawler" genre)
- Clear feedback: game ends immediately on win/lose
- Boss guard prevents sequence breaking (can't skip final fight)

**Implementation:** Checked in two places:
1. HandleGo: Block movement to exit if boss alive
2. HandleGo: After moving to exit, check win condition

---

## Decision 6: EnemyFactory Stub Pattern

**Context:** DungeonGenerator needs enemies, but Barton is implementing enemy classes in parallel.

**Decision:** Created EnemyFactory with internal stub classes (GoblinStub, SkeletonStub, etc.) that compile immediately.

**Rationale:**
- Allows Hill to finish WI-3/WI-4 without waiting for Barton
- Stubs have correct Enemy inheritance and basic stats
- Barton's real classes (Systems/Enemies/) can replace stubs transparently
- Factory pattern centralizes enemy creation logic

**Outcome:** Barton delivered real enemy classes in parallel commit. Stubs remain in code but are unused. Factory now returns real instances.

---

## Decision 7: Automatic Combat Trigger

**Context:** When should combat start?

**Decision:** Combat triggers automatically when player enters room with living enemy. Called immediately in HandleGo after room transition.

**Rationale:**
- Simplifies game flow (no "attack" command needed while moving)
- Aligns with classic dungeon crawler behavior (Zork, NetHack)
- Prevents "run past enemies" exploit

**Alternative Considered:** Manual attack command (rejected: adds micromanagement, less immersive)

---

## Notes for Scribe

These decisions are stable and can be merged to main decisions.md. All contracts (ICombatEngine, CommandType, ParsedCommand) are finalized and used by both Hill and Barton's code.

### 2026-02-20: Code review verdict
**By:** Romanoff  
**What:** WI-10 review outcome — feature-complete quality gate  
**Why:** Quality gate before v1 ships. Reviewed all 23 source files for bugs, logic errors, architectural violations, and edge cases.

**Verdict:** APPROVED ✓

**Issues Found & Fixed (7):**
1. **Architectural violation** — Program.cs used direct Console.Write/ReadLine instead of DisplayService
2. **Architectural violation** — GameLoop.cs used direct Console.Write("> ") for command prompt
3. **Architectural violation** — CombatEngine.cs used direct Console.Write("[A]ttack or [F]lee? ") for combat prompt
4. **Logic bug** — Dead enemies (HP=0) not cleared from room after combat victory, leaving Enemy!=null
5. **Logic inconsistency** — Win condition checked `HP<=0` instead of `Enemy==null`, creating dead-but-present enemy state
6. **Architecture enforcement** — Added ShowCommandPrompt(), ShowCombatPrompt(), ReadPlayerName() to DisplayService
7. **Lifecycle bug** — Fixed GameLoop to set `_currentRoom.Enemy = null` after CombatResult.Won

**Edge cases verified:**
- Empty inventory USE → handled (error message)
- GO with no argument → handled (error message)
- TAKE with no items in room → handled (error message)
- Combat with dead enemy (HP<=0, Enemy!=null) → FIXED (now impossible — enemy cleared on defeat)

**No blocking issues remain.**

**Commit:** eb99612 "fix: code review corrections (WI-10)"

**Rationale for APPROVED:**
- All architectural violations corrected (DisplayService now sole Console I/O owner)
- Logic bugs fixed (dead enemy cleanup ensures consistent state)
- Null safety verified (LootTable = null! safe — always initialized in constructors)
- Edge cases handled properly
- Code is production-ready

Code is ready to ship. No further revisions required.

# Decision: Test Infrastructure Required for v2

**Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Ceremony:** Retrospective  
**Proposed by:** Romanoff, supported by Hill and Barton

## Context
TextGame v1 shipped with zero automated tests. All quality verification was manual (code review, playtesting). Current architecture blocks testability:
- CombatEngine and LootTable create own Random instances (no determinism)
- DisplayService is concrete class, not interface (can't mock console I/O)
- GameLoop tightly couples game state and presentation logic

## Decision
Before any v2 feature work begins, implement test infrastructure:
1. Add unit test framework (xUnit or NUnit)
2. Refactor Random to be injectable for deterministic testing
3. Extract IDisplayService interface for mocking console I/O
4. Create test harness for combat, inventory, and loot systems
5. Document edge cases from WI-10 code review as automated test cases

## Rationale
- Regression risk is HIGH without test coverage
- Confident refactoring requires safety net
- Future features (save/load, balance tuning, new enemies) need regression protection
- Current architecture prevents automated testing

## Impact
- **Blocks:** Any v2 feature work until test infrastructure is in place
- **Requires:** Refactoring of CombatEngine, LootTable, DisplayService consumers
- **Effort estimate:** 1-2 sprints for infrastructure + initial test coverage

## Alternatives Considered
- Continue with manual testing → Rejected: regression risk too high, doesn't scale
- Add tests incrementally as features are added → Rejected: architecture blocks testability now

## Status
Approved by retrospective consensus. Assigned to v2 planning ceremony.

# Decision: Player Encapsulation Refactor

**Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Ceremony:** Retrospective  
**Proposed by:** Hill

## Context
Player model currently has all properties with public setters:
```csharp
public int HP { get; set; }
public int MaxHP { get; set; }
public int Attack { get; set; }
public int Defense { get; set; }
// etc.
```

Nothing prevents invalid state mutations:
- `Player.HP = -100`
- `Player.MaxHP = 0`
- `Player.Attack = -50`

This worked for MVP but blocks future use cases requiring state integrity (save/load, multiplayer, modding, analytics).

## Decision
Refactor Player model to:
1. Private setters on all stat properties
2. Public methods for state transitions: `TakeDamage(int amount)`, `Heal(int amount)`, `ModifyAttack(int delta)`, etc.
3. Validation logic: HP capped at MaxHP, stats can't go negative
4. Event hooks for stat changes (future use: achievements, UI updates, analytics)

## Rationale
- Encapsulation prevents invalid state bugs
- Validation centralizes business rules
- Event hooks enable future extensibility
- Aligns with OOP best practices for domain models

## Impact
- **Owner:** Hill
- **Timing:** Must complete before v2 save/load or stat persistence work
- **Breaking change:** Any external code directly setting Player properties must refactor to use methods
- **Effort estimate:** 2-3 hours (refactor + update all call sites)

## Alternatives Considered
- Keep current public setters → Rejected: highest risk for future extensions
- Partial encapsulation (only HP/MaxHP) → Rejected: inconsistent, defers problem

## Status
Approved by retrospective. Assigned to Hill for v2 planning.

# Decision: DisplayService Interface Extraction

**Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Ceremony:** Retrospective  
**Proposed by:** Romanoff, Hill, Barton

## Context
DisplayService is currently a concrete class with tight coupling to Console:
```csharp
public class DisplayService
{
    public void ShowMessage(string msg) => Console.WriteLine(msg);
    // etc.
}
```

This blocks:
- Headless automated testing (can't mock console I/O)
- Future GUI or web interface implementations
- Test runners that need to capture/verify output

Current architecture requires DisplayService to be injected, but being a concrete class limits testability and extensibility.

## Decision
Extract IDisplayService interface:
1. Define interface with all current DisplayService methods
2. Rename current DisplayService to ConsoleDisplayService : IDisplayService
3. Update all consumers (GameLoop, CombatEngine, InventoryManager) to depend on IDisplayService interface
4. Inject via constructor (already done, just change type from concrete to interface)

## Rationale
- Enables mocking for automated tests (inject TestDisplayService that captures output)
- Opens path for alternative implementations (GUI, web, Discord bot, etc.)
- Follows dependency inversion principle
- Minimal breaking change (consumers already use constructor injection)

## Impact
- **Owners:** Hill (interface extraction, GameLoop update), Barton (CombatEngine update)
- **Timing:** Before v2 testing infrastructure or alternative UI work
- **Breaking change:** None (constructors already accept DisplayService, just change to interface type)
- **Effort estimate:** 1-2 hours (extract interface + update injection sites)

## Alternatives Considered
- Keep concrete class, test by redirecting Console.Out → Rejected: fragile, doesn't enable alternative UIs
- Create parallel test-only display service → Rejected: duplicates code, inconsistent contracts

## Status
Approved by retrospective. Assigned to Hill and Barton for v2 planning coordination.
