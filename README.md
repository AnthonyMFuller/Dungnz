## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnthonyMFuller/Dungnz.git

dotnet run
```

### Enhanced Intro Sequence

The game features an immersive introduction with:
- **ASCII art title screen** with color-coded borders and dramatic tagline
- **Atmospheric lore narrative** setting the scene before your descent
- **Prestige card display** showing your accumulated bonuses from previous wins
- **Interactive class selection** with ASCII stat bars showing HP, Attack, Defense, and Mana with prestige bonuses highlighted

---

## Gameplay

### Core loop

```
Choose class → Explore floor → Fight enemies → Loot rooms
    → Level up → Unlock skills/abilities → Descend → Defeat boss
```

- **Win:** Reach the exit room and defeat the dungeon boss. The dungeon spans **8 floors**, with new bosses on floors 6 (Archlich Sovereign), 7 (Abyssal Leviathan), and 8 (Infernal Dragon).
- **Lose:** Your HP drops to 0 in combat.
- Each floor is a freshly generated grid of interconnected rooms.
- Every 2 levels you are offered a bonus trait: +5 Max HP, +2 Attack, or +2 Defense.
- Defeating the boss grants a **prestige point** every 3 wins, giving permanent cross-run bonuses.

## Combat

### Turn structure

1. Player chooses to **attack**, **use an ability**, or **use an item**.
2. Status effects tick at the end of each round.
3. If the enemy survives, it attacks the player.

damage = Math.Max(1, attacker.Attack - defender.Defense)

## Dungeon Systems

### Room types

Rooms have an environmental flavour that affects the description: **Standard**, **Dark**, **Mossy**, **Flooded**, **Scorched**, **Ancient**.

### Special rooms (Phase 6)

Three high-value special room types are generated in floors 5–8:

| Room | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Forgotten Shrine** | Ancient altar offering blessings or curses with rare rewards |
| **Petrified Library** | Dusty repository with lore scrolls and crafting recipes |
| **Contested Armory** | Abandoned weapon cache with contested elite loot |

### Floor narration

Unique atmospheric narration plays at key floor transitions (5→6, 6→7, 7→8), reflecting the deepening danger of the dungeon's lower levels.

### Hazards

Some rooms contain a floor hazard that triggers on entry:

| Hazard | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Spike | Deals physical damage |
| Poison | Applies Poison status |
| Fire | Deals burn damage |

### Shrines

One-use interactive altars found in some rooms (`use shrine`):

| Option | Cost | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| Heal | 30g | Restore HP to full |
| Bless | 50g | +2 ATK and +2 DEF permanently |
| Fortify | 75g | +10 Max HP permanently |
| Meditate | 75g | +10 Max Mana permanently |

### Merchants

Shop rooms contain a **Merchant** (`shop` command). Floor 1–5 stock staples (Health Potions, Mana Potions, Iron Sword, Leather Armor, Elixir of Strength). Floors 6–8 carry a rotating high-tier inventory including Legendary accessories, floor-exclusive weapons and armor, and guaranteed key consumables (`dragonheart-elixir` on floor 6, `bone-flute` and `panacea` on floor 7, and `crown-of-ascension` on floor 8).

### Item tiers and affixes

119 items are available across **five tiers**: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and **Legendary**.

- **Legendaries** (14 items) carry unique passive effects — e.g. *Aegis of the Immortal* (survive at 1 HP once per combat), *Ironheart Plate* (reflect 25% damage), *Lifedrinker* (vampiric strike on hit).
- **Uncommon+** items have a ~10% chance per affix slot to roll a **Prefix** or **Suffix**, adding bonus stats (e.g. "Keen Iron Sword", "Iron Sword of the Bear").
- **Equipment sets** (Shadowstalker, Ironclad, Arcanist) grant cumulative bonuses for 2- and 3-piece combinations — checked automatically on equip/unequip.
- Many items carry **Class Restrictions** (e.g. Warrior-only, Mage/Necromancer only).

### Crafting

Use `craft <recipe>` to combine ingredients. Gold is consumed along with the listed items.

| Recipe | Ingredients | Gold | Result |
|--------|------------|------|--------|
| Health Elixir | 2× Health Potion | — | Heals 75 HP |
| Reinforced Sword | 1× Iron Sword | 30g | +8 ATK weapon |
| Reinforced Armor | 1× Leather Armor | 25g | +8 DEF armour |

Armor crafting recipes are now available for all equipment slots (Head, Shoulders, Chest, Hands, Legs, Feet, Back, Off-Hand). Browse the full recipe list via the **Petrified Library** special room or `craft` command in-game.

## Display & Colours

Dungnz uses native ANSI escape codes — no third-party dependencies. Colour support is automatic on modern terminals (Windows Terminal, macOS Terminal, Linux).

### What's colour-coded

| Element | Colour |
|---------|--------|
| HP — healthy (> 70%) | Green |
| HP — injured (40–70%) | Yellow |
| HP — critical (20–40%) | Red |
| HP — near death (≤ 20%) | Bright Red |
| Mana — high / medium / low | Blue / Cyan / Gray |
| Gold | Yellow |
| XP gained | Green |
| Attack stat | Bright Red |
| Defense stat | Cyan |
| Combat damage | Red |
| Healing / regen | Green |
| Critical hits | Yellow + Bold |
| Room danger level | Scales green → red |
| Ability on cooldown | Dimmed |

All console output is routed through `IDisplayService` / `DisplayService` — colour constants live in `Systems/ColorCodes.cs`. When equipping items, `EquipmentManager` shows stat deltas with green `+` / red `−` indicators.

The `ColorizeDamage` helper in `CombatEngine` targets only the **last** occurrence of the damage value in a narration string (via `LastIndexOf`) to avoid accidentally colourising an identical number that appears earlier in the message text.

---

## Save System

Game state is persisted to JSON in the user's AppData folder:

```
%AppData%/Dungnz/saves/<name>.json   (Windows)
~/.config/Dungnz/saves/<name>.json   (Linux/macOS)
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `save <name>` | Save current run to a named slot |
| `load <name>` | Restore a saved run by name |
| `list` / `saves` | Show all available save files |

Prestige data lives at `Dungnz/prestige.json` and achievement history at `Dungnz/achievements.json` in the same folder — separate from run saves.

---

## Achievements

Achievements are evaluated on a **won run** only and are saved permanently.

| Achievement | Condition |
|-------------|-----------|
| Glass Cannon | Win with HP below 10 |
| Untouchable | Win without taking any damage |
| Hoarder | Collect 500+ gold in a single run |
| Elite Hunter | Defeat 10+ enemies in a single run |
| Speed Runner | Win in fewer than 100 turns |

View unlocked achievements with `leaderboard`.

## Phase 8: Grand Expansion — Bosses, Balance, Combat & Narrative

### Floor Bosses

Each floor (1–8) now has a unique named boss with a lore identity and a phase ability that triggers mid-fight:

| Floor | Boss | Phase Ability |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Goblin Warchief | Calls reinforcements at 50% HP |
| 2 | Plague Hound Alpha | Blood Frenzy (+5 ATK) at 40% HP |
| 3 | Iron Sentinel | Stunning Blow at 60% HP |
| 4 | Bone Archon | Weaken Aura at 50% HP |
| 5 | Crimson Vampire | Blood Drain (MP drain + self-heal) at 25% HP |
| 6 | Archlich Sovereign | Death Shroud at 40% HP |
| 7 | Abyssal Leviathan | Tentacle Barrage at 50% HP |
| 8 | Infernal Dragon | Flame Breath at 60% HP |

### Class Passives

Each class now has a unique passive trait that activates automatically in combat:

| Class | Passive | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Warrior | Battle Hardened | Gains +2 ATK per 20% HP lost (max +8) |
| Mage | Arcane Surge | Next ability costs 1 less mana after spending mana |
| Rogue | Shadow Strike | First attack each combat deals 2× damage |
| Paladin | Divine Bulwark | Gains Fortified status when HP < 25% (once per combat) |
| Necromancer | Soul Harvest | Heals 5 HP on every kill |
| Ranger | Eagle Eye | +15% dodge chance on turns 1–2 |

### New Status Effects

Three new status effects introduced:

| Effect | Per-turn | Duration | Notes |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Freeze** | — | 2 turns | Cannot act; breaks on physical damage |
| **Silence** | — | 3 turns | Cannot use abilities |
| **Curse** | — | 4 turns | ATK and DEF reduced by 25% |

### Trap Rooms

10% of dungeon rooms are now trap rooms with interactive choices:

| Trap | Choices | Risk / Reward |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Arrow Volley** | Shield or sprint through | Sprint risks damage; shield is safe |
| **Poison Gas Vent** | Sprint or find bypass | Sprint risks Poison; bypass costs a turn |
| **Collapsing Floor** | Leap or cross carefully | Leap risks fall damage but may yield loot |

Careful routes are safer; reckless routes offer bonus loot.

### Environmental Hazards

Rooms can now have persistent environmental hazards that affect every action taken inside:

| Hazard | Floors | Spawn Rate | Effect |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| 🔥 Lava Seam | 7–8 | 15% of rooms | 5 fire damage per action |
| 💀 Corrupted Ground | 5–8 | 10% of rooms | 3 HP drain per action |
| ✨ Blessed Clearing | 1–6 | 8% of rooms | +3 HP regen per action (once per visit) |

### Epic Tier Loot

Epic-tier armor items are now reachable through normal dungeon play:

| Floors | Drop Chance |
|--------|-------------|
| 5–6 | ~8% per loot roll |
| 7–8 | ~15% per loot roll |

### Narrative Systems

- **Room descriptions** vary by floor theme: stone dungeon (1–2) → armory (3–4) → undead domain (5–6) → volcanic abyss (7–8).
- **Item flavor text**: pickups, equip/unequip actions, and consumable use all display flavor lines by tier and item type.
- **Combat narration**: ambient lines for combat start, critical hits, killing blows, and near-death urgency.
- **Boss narration**: all 8 bosses have unique intro, phase-trigger, and death lines delivered by `BossNarration`.
- **Shrines**: outcome text is tailored to shrine type (Heal, Bless, Fortify, Meditate).
- **Merchants**: floor-aware greeting lines reflect the dungeon's deepening danger.

### Process Note

Phase 8 introduced **isolated git worktrees** for parallel agent work on the same repository files, eliminating merge conflicts during concurrent development.

## Testing

**1,279 passing tests** across **68 test files** in `Dungnz.Tests/`.

```bash
dotnet test Dungnz.Tests
```

Coverage includes: `CombatEngine`, `CommandParser`, `CraftingSystem`, `SkillTree`, `PrestigeSystem`, `AchievementSystem`, `StatusEffectManager`, `EquipmentSystem`, `InventoryManager`, `SaveSystem`, `GameLoop` (integration), `DungeonGenerator`, `EnemyFactory`, `LootTable`, `Player`, `DisplayService`, `NarrationService`, `CombatItemUse`, and stub combat engine. Major test suites: Combat variants, enemy factory coverage, integration tests, phase-specific testing, loot distribution, balance simulations, and regression tests.

---

## Contributing

- **XML docs required** on all public members — the project enforces this via existing doc comments.
- **Update README.md** when changing any documented system (commands, enemies, abilities, skills, crafting, saves, achievements). The `readme-check` CI workflow will fail PRs that modify `Engine/`, `Systems/`, `Models/`, or `Data/` without a matching `README.md` change.
- Run `dotnet test Dungnz.Tests` before opening a PR — all tests must pass.
- Follow existing code style: one class per file, `PascalCase` types, `camelCase` locals.
