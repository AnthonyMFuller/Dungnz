## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnthonyMFuller/Dungnz.git

## Gameplay

### Core loop

```
Choose class → Explore floor → Fight enemies → Loot rooms
    → Level up → Unlock skills/abilities → Descend → Defeat boss
```

- **Win:** Reach the exit room and defeat the dungeon boss. The dungeon spans **8 floors**, with new bosses on floors 6 (Archlich Sovereign), 7 (Abyssal Leviathan), and 8 (Infernal Dragon).
- **Lose:** Your HP drops to 0 in combat.
- Each floor is a freshly generated grid of interconnected rooms.
- Every 2 levels you are offered a bonus trait: +5 Max HP, +2 Attack, or +2 Defense.
- Defeating the boss grants a **prestige point** every 3 wins, giving permanent cross-run bonuses.

## Combat

### Turn structure

1. Player chooses to **attack**, **use an ability**, or **use an item**.
2. Status effects tick at the end of each round.
3. If the enemy survives, it attacks the player.
4. Combat ends when either side reaches 0 HP.

damage = Math.Max(1, attacker.Attack - defender.Defense)

## Dungeon Systems

### Room types

Rooms have an environmental flavour that affects the description: **Standard**, **Dark**, **Mossy**, **Flooded**, **Scorched**, **Ancient**.

### Special rooms (Phase 6)

Three high-value special room types are generated in floors 5–8:

| Room | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Forgotten Shrine** | Ancient altar offering blessings or curses with rare rewards |
| **Petrified Library** | Dusty repository with lore scrolls and crafting recipes |
| **Contested Armory** | Abandoned weapon cache with contested elite loot |

### Floor narration

Unique atmospheric narration plays at key floor transitions (5→6, 6→7, 7→8), reflecting the deepening danger of the dungeon's lower levels.

### Hazards

Some rooms contain a floor hazard that triggers on entry:

| Hazard | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Spike | Deals physical damage |
| Poison | Applies Poison status |
| Fire | Deals burn damage |

### Shrines

One-use interactive altars found in some rooms (`use shrine`):

| Option | Cost | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| Heal | 30g | Restore HP to full |
| Bless | 50g | +2 ATK and +2 DEF permanently |
| Fortify | 75g | +10 Max HP permanently |
| Meditate | 75g | +10 Max Mana permanently |

### Merchants

Shop rooms contain a **Merchant** (`shop` command). Floor 1–5 stock staples (Health Potions, Mana Potions, Iron Sword, Leather Armor, Elixir of Strength). Floors 6–8 carry a rotating high-tier inventory including Legendary accessories, floor-exclusive weapons and armor, and guaranteed key consumables (`dragonheart-elixir` on floor 6, `bone-flute` and `panacea` on floor 7, and `crown-of-ascension` on floor 8).

### Item tiers and affixes

119 items are available across **five tiers**: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and **Legendary**.

- **Legendaries** (14 items) carry unique passive effects — e.g. *Aegis of the Immortal* (survive at 1 HP once per combat), *Ironheart Plate* (reflect 25% damage), *Lifedrinker* (vampiric strike on hit).
- **Uncommon+** items have a ~10% chance per affix slot to roll a **Prefix** or **Suffix**, adding bonus stats (e.g. "Keen Iron Sword", "Iron Sword of the Bear").
- **Equipment sets** (Shadowstalker, Ironclad, Arcanist) grant cumulative bonuses for 2- and 3-piece combinations — checked automatically on equip/unequip.
- Many items carry **Class Restrictions** (e.g. Warrior-only, Mage/Necromancer only).

### Crafting

Use `craft <recipe>` to combine ingredients. Gold is consumed along with the listed items.

| Recipe | Ingredients | Gold | Result |
|--------|------------|------|--------|
| Health Elixir | 2× Health Potion | — | Heals 75 HP |
| Reinforced Sword | 1× Iron Sword | 30g | +8 ATK weapon |
| Reinforced Armor | 1× Leather Armor | 25g | +8 DEF armour |

Armor crafting recipes are now available for all equipment slots (Head, Shoulders, Chest, Hands, Legs, Feet, Back, Off-Hand). Browse the full recipe list via the **Petrified Library** special room or `craft` command in-game.

## Display & Colours

Dungnz uses native ANSI escape codes — no third-party dependencies. Colour support is automatic on modern terminals (Windows Terminal, macOS Terminal, Linux).

### What's colour-coded

| Element | Colour |
|---------|--------|
| HP — healthy (> 70%) | Green |
| HP — injured (40–70%) | Yellow |
| HP — critical (20–40%) | Red |
| HP — near death (≤ 20%) | Bright Red |
| Mana — high / medium / low | Blue / Cyan / Gray |
| Gold | Yellow |
| XP gained | Green |
| Attack stat | Bright Red |
| Defense stat | Cyan |
| Combat damage | Red |
| Healing / regen | Green |
| Critical hits | Yellow + Bold |
| Room danger level | Scales green → red |
| Ability on cooldown | Dimmed |

All console output is routed through `IDisplayService` / `DisplayService` — colour constants live in `Systems/ColorCodes.cs`. When equipping items, `EquipmentManager` shows stat deltas with green `+` / red `−` indicators.

The `ColorizeDamage` helper in `CombatEngine` targets only the **last** occurrence of the damage value in a narration string (via `LastIndexOf`) to avoid accidentally colourising an identical number that appears earlier in the message text.

---

## Save System

Game state is persisted to JSON in the user's AppData folder:

```
%AppData%/Dungnz/saves/<name>.json   (Windows)
~/.config/Dungnz/saves/<name>.json   (Linux/macOS)
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `save <name>` | Save current run to a named slot |
| `load <name>` | Restore a saved run by name |
| `list` / `saves` | Show all available save files |

Prestige data lives at `Dungnz/prestige.json` and achievement history at `Dungnz/achievements.json` in the same folder — separate from run saves.

---

## Achievements

Achievements are evaluated on a **won run** only and are saved permanently.

| Achievement | Condition |
|-------------|-----------|
| Glass Cannon | Win with HP below 10 |
| Untouchable | Win without taking any damage |
| Hoarder | Collect 500+ gold in a single run |
| Elite Hunter | Defeat 10+ enemies in a single run |
| Speed Runner | Win in fewer than 100 turns |

View unlocked achievements with `leaderboard`.

```bash
dotnet test Dungnz.Tests
```

Coverage includes: `CombatEngine`, `CommandParser`, `CraftingSystem`, `SkillTree`, `PrestigeSystem`, `AchievementSystem`, `StatusEffectManager`, `EquipmentSystem`, `InventoryManager`, `SaveSystem`, `GameLoop` (integration), `DungeonGenerator`, `EnemyFactory`, `LootTable`, `Player`, `DisplayService`, `NarrationService`, and stub combat engine.

## Contributing

- **XML docs required** on all public members — the project enforces this via existing doc comments.
- **Update README.md** when changing any documented system (commands, enemies, abilities, skills, crafting, saves, achievements). The `readme-check` CI workflow will fail PRs that modify `Engine/`, `Systems/`, `Models/`, or `Data/` without a matching `README.md` change.
- Run `dotnet test Dungnz.Tests` before opening a PR — all tests must pass.
- Follow existing code style: one class per file, `PascalCase` types, `camelCase` locals.
